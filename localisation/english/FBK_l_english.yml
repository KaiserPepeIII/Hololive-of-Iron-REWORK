FBK_shirakami_fubuki: "Shirakami Fubuki"
FBK_shirakami_fubuki_desc: "The proclaimed “Queen of the North”, Shirakami Fubuki is the reigning monarch of Scandinavia. Ruling an empire spanning from Norway to the Russian far north, Fubuki has risen to become one of the most powerful idols in the world with a strong and loyal empire at her disposal.\n\nFubuki started her new life in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire. Disguising herself as a male Baltic-German noble, Fubuki climbed the social hierarchy which got her acquainted with the Finnish populace and nobility, including numerous Pan-Swedish organizations. Later she enlisted in the Imperial Russian Army as an officer. Serving with distinction across numerous campaigns, Fubuki would then be deployed to Galicia upon the outbreak of the Great War. However after numerous defeats and casualties, she resigned from the army. Upon her return to Finland, Fubuki would become more involved in politics, advocating for Finnish independence. When Russia descended into civil war, Fubuki used the opportunity to help Finland gain independence from Russia, however Finland itself fell into chaos. With the help of Mannerheim, Fubuki would defeat the Reds, securing Finland. After this Finland would unify with Sweden thanks to Fubuki's Pan-Swedish allies. Fubuki would then lead her newly formed shock troops, the White Fox Army, into Russia, conquering territory for Finland.\n\nFollowing unification, Fubuki would usurp Gustav V, taking the Swedish throne for herself before leading her forces into Norway and Denmark, uniting Scandinavia under her rule. Her popularity among the people soared as she brought prosperity to Scandinavia thanks to her reforms and free trade. However following rumors of a coup, the elite WFA was exiled to Norway, though still under her control formally. Fubuki's greatest test came in 1932 during the Great Northern War. Fubuki's soldiers and the WFA suffered heavy losses at the hands of Noel's armies, with the war ending in a status-quo antebellum. Recovering from the Northern War, Fubuki must tend to her nation's wounds, as well as the ever increasing instability within the WFA in order for her to maintain her vast northern empire."

  great_depression_fubuki: "Great Depression: Fubuki"
  great_depression_fubuki_desc: "As many economists in Stockholm had predicted, the slump in demand of goods worldwide due to the Great Depression had severely dampened the already ailing economy. Theoretically, stimulous measures would have been the most ideal option but with an unstable political situation dominated by military affairs, additional funding for spending programs would tremendously worsen the existing debt crisis and would require budget cuts for the military; a seemingly absurd proposal."
  white_fox_army: "White Fox Army"
  white_fox_army_desc: "The White Fox Army was formed primarily out of the 2nd and 4th Jaeger Brigades which had fought with Fubuki in the Finnish Civil War (May-December 1916). What originally was just an army group to defeat whatever Russian resistance remained in the Northern tundras became the instrumental force in exerting Fubuki's influence on the Finnish and later Swedish government. However to keep this army loyal , high pay and political positions had to be handed out to all ranks."
  russian_oblasts: "The Oblast Arrangement"
  russian_oblasts_desc: "Once the Treaty of Brugg was signed in 1920, Fubuki remained in control with vast swaths of territory in the former lands of the Russian Empire. With the only other alternative being extreme political unrest, a system of indirect rule was established where each region would elect a council with higher autonomy than other territories within the country. However, this system soon backfired as these councils held much sympathy for local Russian remnant rebel cells. Despite constant pushes to do away with the system, Russian volunteer soldiers were necessary to retain order not only in the oblasts, but in the home territories of Scandinavia. Thus, a careful balance needed to be made in order to prevent any coorperation between the Russian and Scandinavian rebels. With Fubuki now in absolute control, she looks to finally reform the Oblast arrangements."

 GNW_FBK: "Pre-GNW Fubuki"
 GNW_FBK_through_the_fire_and_flames: "Through the Fire and the Flames"
 GNW_FBK_fixing_our_military: "Examining our Military"
 GNW_FBK_fixing_our_military_desc: "The current state of our military is sadly laughable. Many inexperienced officers, outdated doctrines, outdated weaponries, some conscripts can barely even fire their guns, and many other issues. If we really wish our war against Noel will go smooth, these issues must be addressed."
 GNW_FBK_logistic_issses: "Dealing with Logistics"
 GNW_FBK_logistic_issses_desc: "The logistics management has been a nightmare. The lack of logistics vehicles, limited access to the frontline, chokepoints, and barely enough supply depots for the entire frontline are getting more pressing. Even the most well equipped army will crumble without logistics, so the sooner we address these issues, the better."
 GNW_FBK_war_won_by_sea: "Victory by Sea"
 GNW_FBK_war_won_by_sea_desc: "The sea is a complex frontier where there is no “frontline” and movements are more fluid. It is also undeniably crucial for the war effort. Let us make our old seafaring ancestors proud, rule the waves to drain Noel's military dry of material and supplies and strike closer to their homeland by naval invasions"
 GNW_FBK_war_won_by_land: "Victory by Land"
 GNW_FBK_war_won_by_land_desc: "Of course, the war on land is ultimately the most important frontier. Noel and her barbaric army shall never ravage our beautiful Nordic homeland. Her army must be crushed once and for all, show her that her proud “Prussian” army stand no chance against ours, onwards to Königsberg!"
 GNW_FBK_lessons_from_courland: "Lessons from Courland"
 GNW_FBK_lessons_from_courland_desc: "During the Great Northern War, a considerable chunk of Noel's army was trapped in Courland, it was known as the Courland Pocket. Despite being cut-off far from the main force along the Neman river, they held their position until the end of the war as we were unable to penetrate their defences. Learning new breakthrough tactics is a must, so that we will never waste such opportunities ever again"
 GNW_FBK_improved_land_doctrine: "Improved Land Doctrine"
 GNW_FBK_improved_land_doctrine_desc: "Best soldiers, best weaponries, best equipment,  all don't matter when the doctrines being used are bad and/or outdated. If we really wish to bring Noel to her knees, to ensure our ultimate and final victory against her, we have to improve our doctrines"
 GNW_FBK_dealing_with_other_matters: "The Propaganda Office"
 GNW_FBK_dealing_with_other_matters_desc: "The bloodbath of the Great Northern War burned through our resources and planted the seeds of defeatism and treachery in the hearts of our men, lowering the support for a new war. To even have a chance in the upcoming trials, we must restore the battle spirit of our army and population."
 GNW_FBK_securing_our_borders: "Securing Our Borders"
 GNW_FBK_securing_our_borders_desc: "While we are focusing on Noel, we shouldn't forget about our Russian border, as they could easily strike us while we are bogged down with the upcoming conflict. For the sake of national security we have to double down on our fortifications to minimize this risk."
 GNW_FBK_secure_baltic_loyalty: "Secure Baltic Loyalty"
 GNW_FBK_secure_baltic_loyalty_desc: "The Baltic region was always a hotspot full of separatists, causing havoc and chaos in an effort to achieve their independence. Dealing with them proved to be quite a costly endeavour, so perhaps we could calm the situation down by giving them a level of autonomy and allowing the local population to participate in the political life of their territories"
 GNW_FBK_secure_russian_loyalty: "Secure Russian Loyalty"
 GNW_FBK_secure_russian_loyalty_desc: "Native resistance on the eastern territories continues since our acquisition of them during the intervention in the Russian Civil War. All previous attempts to appease them failed, as their wish for succession to join Russia yet again obviously cannot be granted. As such, we must strengthen our grip on the region and root out the separatist organisations to ensure lasting stability before the war."
 GNW_FBK_secure_german_loyalty: "Secure German Loyalty"
 GNW_FBK_secure_german_loyalty_desc: "Our lands in Germany are under constant threat not only from Noel, but other german states as well. Thankfully, our people are historically pretty close, so with the right initiative, integration of these lands shouldn't take too long. Alternatively we could just set up a puppet state within these territories, but this refusal to deal with the german nationalism within our fold would surely have consequences"
 GNW_FBK_increased_wfa_participation: "Increased WFA Participation"
 GNW_FBK_increased_wfa_participation_desc: "While WFA's performance during the war was quite poor and their leadership turned on us at the first signs of our weakness, we must admit that its soldiers and officers are still heroes and patriots, who bravely fought against Noel's forces. Those who proved to be loyal to our cause should be allowed to serve their country once again."
 GNW_FBK_wf_jaeger_units: "4th WF Jaeger Division"
 GNW_FBK_wf_jaeger_units_desc: "Our collaboration with loyal WFA troops proved to be a massive success, as most experienced of them are now organised into jaeger units and ready to do their duty. They shall become the core of the army's elite, with which we will utterly crush our enemy."
 GNW_FBK_our_war: "Var Kamp"
 GNW_FBK_our_war_desc: "This war isn't just another conflict, this is a fire in which our future will be forged. We shouldnt think about what was before or would be after the war, we must live in and be one with it if we want to survive through its hardships and horrors."
 GNW_FBK_a_war_for_liberty: "A War for Justice"
 GNW_FBK_a_war_for_liberty_desc: "Our war is just, for we are fighting not just for ourselves, but also for the restoration of Kronii's nation on the map of Europe. With this, we shall teach a lesson to Noel and to all those who wish to disturb the order on the continent, that their injust acts against a fellow nation will not be ignored!"
 GNW_FBK_renewed_conscription: "Renewed Conscription Efforts"
 GNW_FBK_renewed_conscription_desc: "With the war placing a heavy strain on our armed forces, more men must be called up to fight against Noel's tyranny."
 GNW_FBK_together_for_victory: "Together for Victory"
 GNW_FBK_together_for_victory_desc: "There should be no place for internal strife and disagreements during the war. All citizens of the Empire must rally around Fubuki and be friends with each other, to meet our enemy as one united front."
 GNW_FBK_a_war_for_national_revival: "A War for National Revival"
 GNW_FBK_a_war_for_national_revival_desc: "The war will cleanse our country with fire and steel, forging the strong and independent nation. No sacrifice is too big for such a noble goal, as those who died shall be the foundation of this new free Scandinavia."
 GNW_FBK_we_fight_or_die: "We Fight or Die"
 GNW_FBK_we_fight_or_die_desc: "This war is one of survival, for our enemy shall not rest until our nation and ideals are scattered in the wind. To live on, we must steel ourselves and be prepared to fight against Noel forces to the last man, for the sake of our future."
 GNW_FBK_increased_mobilisation: "Increased Mobilisation"
 GNW_FBK_increased_mobilisation_desc: "During such a difficult time, the whole nation must take up arms to fight against our foes and defend the empire."
 GNW_FBK_common_cause: "A Common Cause"
 GNW_FBK_the_air_war: "The Air War"
 GNW_FBK_the_air_war_desc: "The rapid development of aircraft for the past two decades has cemented their importance in future wars. Not only can they be used to shoot down enemy planes and wreak havoc upon enemy combatants on the ground, they can also strike deep behind enemy lines and target their logistics and industry. Let us master the skies to not only cripple Noel's army, but also protect our skies so the same cannot be done to us."
 GNW_FBK_lessons_from_konigsberg: "Lessons from Konigsberg"
 GNW_FBK_lessons_from_konigsberg_desc: "The utter humiliation at Königsberg during the Great Northern War in 1932 was an unrecoverable wound for us. But that shall never discourage us. Instead, we must look back and learn from it so the same mistake will never happen again. Never another Königsberg"
 GNW_reexamine_tanks: "Re-Examine Our Tanks"
 GNW_reexamine_tanks_desc: "Tanks are essential for land warfare. They are the key for breaking through enemy lines or as mobile armoured defensive platforms. We have to re-examine our tanks to ensure their effectiveness on the battlefield."
 GNW_FBK_renewed_naval_landings: "Renewed Naval Landing Efforts"
 GNW_FBK_renewed_naval_landings_desc: "In order to not repeat another disaster like Königsberg, it is important to renew our naval landing tactics by learning what we did wrong and what we should do in the future. We should also create a new elite unit specialised in naval landing operations. To not repeat the past we must look to the past."
 GNW_FBK_organised_resistance: "Organised Resistance"
 GNW_FBK_organised_resistance_desc: "In several of Noel's territories, there are those who refuse to be slaves under Noel's tyranny. With the right weapons and training, these freedom fighters can severely hinder Noel's war effort."
 GNW_FBK_for_victory: "En Svensk Tiger!"
 GNW_FBK_for_victory_desc: "All preparations are complete and our army awaits the orders. Now only the fires of the battlefield will determine if we succeeded or not. Onwards to our destiny!"

FBK_depoliticize_army: "Depoliticize The Army"
FBK_depoliticize_army_desc: "In the following years, numerous officers have aligned themselves to various political groups across the empire. Seeing that this could jeopardize national security, it is essential that the army remain free of any political influence."
FBK_reinforce_wfa: "Reinforce the WFA"
FBK_reinforce_wfa_desc: "The elite White Fox Army is the vanguard of any advance, and the last line of defense from any foreign enemy. To maintain this elite force, they will need more men and weapons."
FBK_depoliticize_the_navy: "Depoliticize the Navy"
FBK_depoliticize_the_navy_desc: "Much like the army, our navy also has the problem of officers siding with different political parties. To properly operate, a strict policy of no political alignment must be maintained."
FBK_expand_the_airforce: "Expand the Airforce"
FBK_expand_the_airforce_desc: "Time and time again, air power has proven itself to be the deciding factor in any conflict. With new pilots and more of the latest planes, it can be the best air force on the continent."
FBK_purge_the_wfa: "Purge the WFA"
FBK_purge_the_wfa_desc: "For too long, the White Fox Army has been a breeding ground of radical extremism and subversive activity. An armed and well trained force of radicals simply cannot be allowed to roam freely."
FBK_rule_from_stockholm: "Direct Rule from Stockholm"
FBK_rule_from_stockholm_desc: "Allowing the WFA to govern Norway as they please is too much of a risk. We must reintegrate Norway into the empire and bring the WFA under the control of the army."
FBK_expand_cnsi: "Expand the CNSI"
FBK_expand_cnsi_desc: "Foreign espionage and domestic subversion remains an ever-present threat in the empire. Expanding the personnel and resources of the CNSI will help defend against this."
FBK_fubu_youth_corps: "Form the Youth Corps"

FBK_four_year_plan: "The Four Year Plan"

FBK_liberalize_markets: "Liberalize the Markets"
FBK_liberalize_markets_desc: "With the end of emergency war time powers, the people can indulge themselves in the latest products made by our companies. Loosened regulations will allow better innovation and growth through competition."
FBK_expand_state_industry: "Expand State Industry"
FBK_expand_state_industry_desc: "State controlled industry is still an important source of income for our economy. The building of more factories will create jobs and be useful in peacetime and war."
FBK_liquidate_failing_assets: "Liquidate Failing Assets"
