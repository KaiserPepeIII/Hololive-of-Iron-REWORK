SAN_tsukomi_sana: "Tsukumo Sana"
SAN_tsukomi_sana_desc: "Tsukumo Sana is a small warlord in the fragmented lands of Central Asia. Of all the various warlord states in the region, Sana's arguably has the most organization and centralization of all of them, albeit at a smaller size in territory and population. Sana's state preaches a special variant of Russian Cosmism with Sana's characteristics.\n\nEarly in the 1900s, Sana was a popular astrologist amongst Russian nobles in St. Petersburg and over time developed a unique doctrine of Cosmism that blends Hololive Yagooist characteristics with technocracy and traditional Russian Cosmism. She creates a faction of followers of her philosophy who aided in the Hololive Revolution, but performs poorly against the Reds and Whites. Sana and her followers narrowly escape to Central Asia thanks to the help of Rushia, setting up camp in Tajikistan.\n\nSana currently must survive the harsh lands of Central Asia to make it back to Russia to continue spreading her brand of Cosmism. Perhaps Sana can convert some locals to her philosophy, and thanks to the belief in technocracy and reaching the stars, Sana's state has developed rocket technology unseen before in the world which should put her at a great advantage in the region."
