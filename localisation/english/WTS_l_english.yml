WTS_amelia_watson: "Amelia Watson"
WTS_amelia_watson_desc: "An expert in time travel and history, Watson was chosen to be the first member of the Hololive Agency to travel to the past. She was to ensure that her special pocket watch would work as intended and to secure the 'landing site' for the rest of the idols. Although she was aiming for London in the year 1900, her pocket watch was slightly off, causing Watson to land in English South Africa in the year 1899. Before she could truly get her bearings, the conflicts with the Dutch Boers escalated into the Second Boer War, a messy guerilla conflict. As thousands of British volunteers flooded into South Africa, Watson joined the Army Nursing Reserve. Watson served in the Second Boer War with distinction, saving dozens of lives and creating her famous “Watsons Concoction” which has saved so many lives.\n\nAfter the war, Watson traveled to Britain, where she was awarded with medals for her service. Watson began to integrate into British society, using her wartime prestige to host a social club called the 'Teammates', which featured many future political leaders among its ranks. Watson and her Teammates garnered respect from all social classes by calling for widespread social reforms, such as women's suffrage, free trade laws, and greater Irish autonomy. The Teammates would go on to become a crucial support of Watsons political career, but for some few years it functioned mainly as a group of political free-thinkers, who would be quick to accept Hololivism. These Teammates formed the backbone of Watsons power.\n\nOnce the Great War was unleashed upon Europe in 1912, the British government placed restrictions on striking and political unrest in the country. Despite this, Watson and her Teammates began talking in secret of an uprising, encouraging draft dodging and backing anti-war propaganda. The Teammates, with many young middle and upper class supporters, rapidly garnered funding for an uprising. The Uprising would come in September of 1916, after the Verdun Armistice which organized a ceasefire between the Central Powers and the Entente. Watson would lead her Teammates and revolutionaries in a violent campaign against the British parliament, which tore the country apart.\n\nThe revolution ended with Hololivist supremacy in Great Britain, with Watson installed as the executive power in Britain. She reigned for several years in peace, until additional rebellions broke out in Northern England and Scotland. After years of fighting, Watson was forced to sign a defeated peace with these rebel factions. The Anti-States of Northern England, Scotland, and the Republic of Ireland rose again, swearing to work together against the Hololive cause.\n\nAnd so Watson leads her people into the second half of the 1930s, with a battered economy and torn country trailing behind her. There are threats in the form of dissidents, traitors, and Anti-states; yet first there is one great question that must be answered. Before Watson can begin to face other threats, she must first pass critical legislation for her regime. The budget must be approved. Despite it all, though, Watson and her supporters are optimistic. London will prevail. Britannia will be united once more, no matter what it may cost."

WTS_ira_presence: "Elevated IRA Presence"
WTS_ira_presence_loc: "\nThe IRA, Irish Republican Army, although in practice a variety of different groups, is an organisation which is anti-Watson, anti-Fauna and supports the full unification of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The group has had a prolonged struggle against English rule and continues to be a major headache for the Watson regime."
WTS_bgc_presence: "Elevated BGC Presence"
WTS_bgc_presence_loc: "\nThe Byddin Gweriniaeth Cymru, or Welsh Republican Army, was a violent group that emerged from the ashes of the Great War in defiance to the Watson regime and previous Welsh nationalist movements which were primarily focused on a revival of Welsh culture. As the economic situation for the Watson regime worsened and nationalist strife began to dramatically increase, many flocked to the BGC and even revolted against their Hololive overlords in the 1931 Revolution. However, they were quickly driven underground where they continue to attack all those who oppose their aims."
WTS_english_antis_presence: "Elevated English-Antis Presence"
WTS_english_antis_presence_loc: "\nAlthough many fled northwards to join the revolution in 1931, a large portion of Antis remained in the South and Midlands. Once the revolution was over however, much of those who were left behind in Watson territory resorted to more extreme acts of insurrection. Due to support in the form of manpower and weapons from all over the isle, the English Anti cells in Watson territory are deadly and a force to reckon with; even in ther small and disorganized bands."
WTS_national_protection_league: "National Teammates League"
WTS_national_protection_league_loc: "\nFormed in reaction to the IRA, the National Teammates League is a group of pro-Watson paramilitaries that aims to defend all citizen. Behind this notion of defence, the NTL essentially fights a war against the IRA, BGC and English Antis whom they see as the ultimate enemy and have no qualms in resorting to aggressive acts of violence against."

WTS_class_factions_desc: "The Great War and Hololive Revolution knocked the British social ladder over as all men, women and children witnissed the carnage of war on their doorstep. It however did not completely erase the boundaries of class that had very flamboyantly been displayed in the previous century. All these groups in society have different views ranging from old-school Victorian era liberalism to the modern nationalists who are willing to sacrifice everything to change the direction of their supposedly decadent nation.\n\n Westminster must be able to carefully balance and appease these groups without creating a political deadlock."

watson_upper_class_bar_loc: "[WTS_upper_class_bar_support]\n\nThe English aristocracy and bourgeosie, the former backbone of the English political class, find themselves weaker than ever before. Nevertheless their support is vital for the smooth running of the state and the economy. They largely prefer the status quo and conservative politics. The establishment of the Westminster Constitution would be an unfathomable affront to their values."
watson_middle_class_bar_loc: "[WTS_middle_class_bar_support]\n\nDespite the hard times of the 1910s and 1920s, classic British 'meritocracy' had allowed for few to rise or maintain their middle class position in the social hierarchie. Support for the Westminster Constituion and other policies is divided but, the middle class uncomprimisingly wish to maintain their newly enshrined suffrage."
watson_lower_class_bar_loc: "[WTS_lower_class_bar_support]\n\nFactories, farms and workhouses emptied out in the Great War as men of all ages died on continental and British soil alike. What followed in the decade long 'peace' was an astonnishingly decent time for the worse off Britons. Wage increases, labour laws, vacation time and other pro-Worker policies were enacted by the Teammate government. As a result although a violent Marxist revolution was avoided, the Britain that emerged in the 20s was the very opposite of its Victorian predecessor. Despite this immense growth however, Britain's poor still hunger for social and economic change; with London's East End being a breeding ground for political movements."
watson_ulster_class_bar_loc: "[WTS_ulster_teammates_bar_support]\n\nTraditional Northern Irish society broke down as its men fought in the bloodiest front of the entire war, with well over a quarter of all people in the region perishing. What remained after the Treaty of Brugg was a bitterly divided country that were willing to pick up arms once more to avenge their fallen comrades. Irish Republicans, old school British unionists and pro-Watson teammates all began an unprecedented set of violent, sectarian skirmishes that not even Westminster could have intervened in. The Northern Irish today are bloodthirsty for any change to the status quo and are willing to fight and die for it."

watson.47.t: "Optimised Weapon Manufacturing"
watson.47.d: "In recent years the Ministry of Defence has formed a number of 'Defence Research Establishments' designed to seek progression in all forms of military research and development (R&D). /nThe Armaments Research Department (ARD) in particular has conducted a series of experiments on the production of infantry weapons in order to help better understand the issues of manufacturing complicated weapon components and the rather extended lengths of time it takes to do so. /n/nThese general tests have resulted in design changes that will help reduce the overall number of complex parts needed to assemble such weapons, as well as refining the manufacturing processes to be far more efficient in terms of workers and equipment required. This breakthrough will surely see the development of a new, better infantry weapon!"
watson.47.a: "New infantry weapons!"

watson.48.t: "Advancements in Support Items"
watson.48.d: "The ARD have further sought for the implementation of a brand new support company, or at the very least advancements in a pre-existing one. For what specific purpose is currently unknown and will ultimately be left up to the decision of higher military command. /n/nWhat is known, however, is that considerable time, money, and resources have been invested in the production of new, better support equipment that would offer a wide range of different field operations for deployed troops. These investments will surely see new innovations in our support companies!"
watson.48.a: "New support items!"

watson.49.t: "Breakthrough in Armour"
watson.49.d: "In recent years the Ministry of Defence has formed a number of 'Defence Research Establishments' designed to seek progression in all forms of military R&D. /nThe Royal Armoured Research and Development Establishment (RARDE) in particular have experimented with a new set of metallic alloys that could be adapted into a strong yet flexible armour for tanks. The benefits of these new-found alloys don't stop just there however, as the production of them may be even cheaper and easier to mass-produce than previous designs. /n/nThis breakthrough will surely see the development of a harder, faster armoured tank! The only question remaining now is, what model should we put our attention towards - Light, Medium, or Heavy?"
watson.49.a: "A new Light Armour Tank!"
watson.49.b: "A new Medium Armour Tank!"
watson.49.c: "A new Heavy Armour Tank!"

watson.50.t: "New Aircraft"
watson.50.d: "In recent years the Ministry of Defence has formed a number of 'Defence Research Establishments' designed to seek progression in all forms of military R&D. The Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in particular have invented a new type of crankshaft that could easily help stabilisation of modern aircraft. This part would, however, still need to be adapted depending on the type of aircraft chosen, and thus it's up to higher administration to decide where the focus should lie. /nThis breakthrough will surely see the developement of a new, better plane, but we must choose from focusing on Fighters, Tactical Bombers, or Strategic Bombers."
watson.50.a: "A new Fighter!"
watson.50.b: "A new Tactical Bomber!"
watson.50.c: "A new Strategic Bomber!"

watson.51.t: "The Invention of RDF"
watson.51.d: "In recent years the Ministry of Defence has formed a number of 'Defence Research Establishments' designed to seek progression in all forms of military R&D. The Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) were especially formed recently to coincide with the invention of RDF, or Range and Direction Finding, that can detect and track enemy aircraft from long distances. The Daventry Experiment showed that radio signals reflected from an aircraft could indeed be detected and so research funds were quickly allocated for continued breakthroughs in technology relating to radio signals and waves. While this branch is fairly experimental, all men working on said projects are very eager to see further successes in this new uncharted territory of science!"
watson.51.a: "A new form of communication!"

watson.57.d: "The RARDE have decided to invest their alloys into a new heavy armour tank."
watson.57.a: "Yay for a new type of Heavy Armour!"

watson.58.t: "Nuclear Discovery"
watson.58.d: "A completely separate effort from the Ministry of Defence's 'Defence Research Establishments', the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) have done the unthinkable and split the nuclei of an atom. With this potentially catastrophic discovery now in our hands, only time will tell how our great nation will use this new-found power: as a violent weapon to wreak havoc on our foes, or as a useful source of energy to power the country? The Teammates wait anxiously."
watson.58.a: "The Kingdom of Watson shall harness the unbelievable power of nuclear energy!"

watson.59.t: "The Power of Rockets"
watson.59.d: "In recent years the Ministry of Defence has formed a number of 'Defence Research Establishments' designed to seek progression in all forms of military R&D. The Aeroplane and Experimental Armaments Establishment (A&AEE) in particular have invented a much larger, heavier warhead that will help with the center of gravity of missiles and expand their storage for more explosives. The adaptation of this new warhead will greatly expand our nation's surface-to-surface rocket usage."
watson.59.a: "The Kingdom of Watson shall harness the power of missiles and rockets!"

watson.60.t: "Advanced Research Capabilities"
watson.60.d: "The Ministry of Defence has seen continued and unprecedented success in its Research Establishments and thus has been able to increase its funding and further expand its facilities to encompass an ever wider array of R&D. /n/n The Kingdom of Watson shall soon see breakthroughs in a multitude of areas!"
watson.60.a: "The fruits of our labour have truly paid off!"

WTS_the_easter_crisis: "The Easter Crisis"
WTS_the_easter_crisis_desc:  "We have passed the date required for an allocation of the budget and no census has been reached. Our current government is in shambles and the future of our nation is looking dire. This whole situation has taught us one thing - reforms are needed! We can either continue the status quo while preventing any further issues like this from occurring, OR, cut the head off the snake and create a new constitution entirely."
WTS_the_antis_question: "Dealing with Antis"
WTS_the_antis_question_desc: "Enemies! Enemies all around us! These "Antis" as they have decided to call themselves take on many different forms. The rebellious English and Scottish Nationalists to our north will need hard-pressed wars and outside support for us to finally reclaim Great Britain. Closer to home the IRA has launched a terror campaign in their struggle to reunite the Emerald isle - how we deal with them is a far more complicated issue that can't be solved on the battlefield. Who should we strike first? And should we be uncompromising or open-handed in our approach?"
WTS_the_military_inspection: "The State of the Military"
WTS_the_military_inspection_desc: "In a recent inspection done by Her Majesty's Armed Forces, they found that the current state of the military compared to the relative strength of other nations, is to be quite frank... absolutely appalling. Our nation would have a hard time protecting itself if we were to come under an attack, let alone to prepare any sort of viable offensive war. We should take considerable steps to expand and modernize our fighting force."
WTS_a_new_government: "A New Government"
WTS_a_new_government_desc: "Continuing the status quo is far easier said than done. The Easter Crisis has shown that our current legislation is riddled with flaws and loopholes that could have drastic unforeseen consequences for our nation in times to come. We must rectify these issues while still preserving our current parliamentary democracy."
WTS_the_westminster_constitution: "The Westminster Constitution"
WTS_the_westminster_constitution_desc:  "The tumultuous events of the past few weeks have proven one thing; the present parliamentary system has to change. Amelia Watson has looked into possibilities of ways to change this order and has thus ordered an inquiry into the possibility of drafting a new “Westminster Constitution,” a document that would supersede the unwritten constitution that had served Britain in years past. Hopefully, it can mark a new steadier era for the country."
WTS_the_budget: "The Budget"
WTS_the_budget_desc: "The upcoming budget is perhaps one of the most consequential pieces of legislation drafted in recent memory. With the instability and polarization that had caused the numerous crises coming to a head in the Easter Crisis all those months prior, it is all the more important that we clearly outline what we want with this budget."
WTS_socialist_budget: "A Socialist Budget"
WTS_socialist_budget_desc: "The lower classes have been the fuel that helped propel Britain forward ever since the Industrial Revolution. However, they have long been abused, mistreated, and frequently forgotten about. We must not do the same things, however. The new budget will help ensure Britain's workers can share the fruits of their labour together!"
WTS_four_year_plan: "The Recovery Plan"
WTS_four_year_plan_desc: "It will be a long recovery process, but when we come out the other end of it we'll be far better off."
WTS_renegotiate_trade_deals: "Renegotiate our Trade Deals"
WTS_renegotiate_trade_deals_desc: "Historically this nation has been in almost perfect equilibrium when it came to the import and export of resources. With the Empire now gone and having been reduced to our bare-bones resources here on the mainland, we may end up in a tight position going forward. The LHS is pushing us to maintain our current trade laws, if not opening them up even more, and while this may benefit us in the long run - production will always need raw resources, so seeking protectionism in trade may prove more beneficial for that alone."
WTS_conservative_budget: "A Conservative Budget"
WTS_conservative_budget_desc: "Money is precious these days, especially with growing instabilities worldwide. We cannot spend needlessly on welfare projects or social security at this time; they might get abused anyway. We should develop a budget that prioritises balancing the books above all else, so we do not get caught under a debt trap."
WTS_reverse_brain_drain: "Reverse the Brain Drain"
WTS_reverse_brain_drain_desc: "Our nation cannot function if our best and brightest put their talent in the service of foreign nations instead of at home. We must offer incentives to ensure that we preserve these talents within our nation so that they may serve its people first and foremost."
WTS_british_science: "British Science"
WTS_british_science_desc: "To further incentivize our homegrown talent, our government should sponsor new research grants as part of the British Science Fund. With this fund, we can show ourselves and the world how British Science is the best in the world!"
WTS_scholarships_and_grants: "Restore the Academia"
WTS_scholarships_and_grants_desc: "Our industrial capacity is back at our former glory, thanks to our efforts in reinvigorating the spirits of our technological research. We should not just stop now, however. By fully restoring the British Academy, we may ensure that our scientific progress shall never be lost again!"
WTS_privitisation_act: "The Privatization Plan"
WTS_privitisation_act_desc: "Our government is running out of money. If we do not do something drastic fast, we will spiral into an ever-increasing deficit with no way out. Luckily, many businessmen and big companies are willing to share our burden if only we privatize some of our public assets. If that means we may have financial stability, so be it."
WTS_lower_taxes: "Lower Taxes"
WTS_lower_taxes_desc: "The high corporate taxes currently in place can drain the financial resources of even the most financially responsible corporation in our country. With our current stagnant status, we should lower such rates to ensure that these corporations have more financial room to play with. While this is admittedly a risky endeavour, as that would mean even less money for our government, we should have faith that these corporations can better succeed with the new financial gains they would bring."
WTS_establish_free_trade: "Establish Free Trade"
WTS_establish_free_trade_desc: "Britain must be seen as a safe and profitable place to trade with again. By adopting a free-trade policy, we can thus invite foreign investors in, as well as increase demand for our goods. We can then use the momentum generated from these actions to kickstart our economy again!"
WTS_reduce_regulations: "Reduce Regulations"
WTS_reduce_regulations_desc: "What good are regulations anyway? All they do is stifle progress and innovation with the shortcomings of bureaucracy. Let us remove government regulations on our companies, which is suffering as much as we have, and let the free market do the rest of the work."
WTS_northern_ireland_pacified: "Quiet in Ulster"
WTS_northern_ireland_pacified_desc: ""Ulster: the most unstable part of our nation. Long has it been plagued with sectarian violence and anti activity, terrorizing our citizens with disruptions and terrorism. However, we can safely report that those days are in the past. The people of Northern Ireland and Britain at large can finally sleep knowing that Ulster's stability has been restored.""
WTS_pressure_on_the_emerald_isle: "Pressure on the Emerald Isle"
WTS_pressure_on_the_emerald_isle_desc: "Ireland is still a part of our Isles. If Ireland were to fall to hostile influences, it could represent a grave breach of our national security interests. While we still can, we must pressure Ireland to ensure that they continue to align with our interests to ensure that our sphere of influence remains strong."
WTS_another_northern_irish_solution: "Return to the Diplomatic Table"
WTS_another_northern_irish_solution_desc: "Ulster: the most unstable part of our nation. Long has it been plagued with sectarian violence and anti activity, terrorizing our citizens with disruptions and terrorism. It is clear that holding onto that area is more trouble than it is worth. We should negotiate with all of the various factions in Ulster, to see if a diplomatic breakthrough can be made to end the troubles."
WTS_never_another_battle: "A Permanent Peace in Albion"
WTS_never_another_battle_desc: "Ireland is still part of our Isles. However, it has made its desire to keep its independence clear. If we want permanent peace in the Isles, it would be best to let them live and engage with them via diplomacy and peace rather than war and aggression. Let us put past grievances behind us, and walk forward to a new future for both our nations!"
WTS_invade_ireland: "Reclaim the Isle"
WTS_invade_ireland_desc: "Ireland is still part of our Isles. Therefore, why should we continue to let them stand on their own and continue causing harm to our nation? Britain owned Ireland before, and Britain should own Ireland again."
WTS_irish_nation_building: "Irish Nation Building"
WTS_irish_nation_building_desc: "Ireland has always been less developed than the other parts of the Isles. With Ireland in our grasp, we would obtain their gratitude if we invested substantially in their lands, to ensure that the Emerald Isle can be stable for years to come." 
WTS_reuniting_the_crowns: "Reuniting the Crowns"
WTS_reuniting_the_crowns_desc: "We are Britannia, and yet we do not even own all of Britain. Our wayward crowns have departed, and not even England is united with troublemakers still lining across the North. Now that our domestic situation has finally settled, it is time to finally start efforts to restore these lost crowns to reclaim Britannia's glory!"
WTS_seek_lhs_military_support: "Seek LHS Support"
WTS_seek_lhs_military_support_desc: "WIth the country once again thrown into conflict, we must make contact once more with our LHS benefactors. If they have any sense, they will send us to help to defeat this enemy that threatens the global peace of the world that they are so committed to achieving."
WTS_seek_alternative_sources: "Seek Alternative Sources"
WTS_seek_alternative_sources_desc: "Why should we make deals with the LHS? Their ambitions are too idealistic and pacifistic, which would not serve this country well. We must look to alternative routes that can align better with our agenda than the LHS and their mistaken ideals."
WTS_operation_ground_pound: "Operation Ground Pound"
WTS_operation_ground_pound_desc: "Our preparations are finally complete. With our backers and our troops mustered, it is time to finally take back our country again. Nothing beats a ground pound!"
WTS_the_sun_never_sets: "The Sun Never Set"
WTS_the_sun_never_sets_desc: "Long has Britain bled through the past few years. The past decades have been the hardest in Britain's history, with our fair nation being weak and divided. But now the sun shall rise again over Britannia as we return to the world stage!"
WTS_examine_the_army: "Examine the Army"
WTS_examine_the_army_desc: "Our army quality has degraded significantly over the years, owing to the collapse of Britain. If we want to reunite Britain, we must bring it up to speed."
WTS_examine_the_navy: "Examine the Navy"
WTS_examine_the_navy_desc: "The Royal Navy was once the enforcer of the great Pax Britannica. Now it sits rotting in abandoned shipyards, making us susceptible to naval domination. Such a situation must not happen; we must ensure our Navy is restored."
WTS_harts_reforms: "Hart's Reforms"
WTS_harts_reforms_desc: "We should recruit the great B. H. Liddell Hart. It's his ingenious use of fast-moving armour that will be the crux of innovation for our army going forward. A full military reform using his ideas will save countless lives and inflict more casualties on the enemy by focusing assault only on parts of the front line with the least resistance."
WTS_combined_arms_doctrine: "Combined Arms Doctrine"
WTS_combined_arms_doctrine_desc: "With Liddell now in a proper position to implement his reforms army-wide, we have already seen massive changes in the combat effectiveness of motorized and armoured divisions."
WTS_artillery_investments: "Artillery Support"
WTS_artillery_investments_desc: "In some ways not much has changed since the conflicts of the Great War. Artillery still proves generally useful on the front line and taking steps to improve our models would be greatly beneficial."
WTS_motorized_yeomanry: "Motorized Yeomanry"
WTS_motorized_yeomanry_desc: "The speed of divisions and safe transport of supplies are the two aspects of warfare that will always be vital until the very ends of time. Taking steps to improve the fighting capabilities and armour of our transport vehicles will grant us great strides against our enemies."
WTS_war_of_manouvre: "A War of Maneuver"
WTS_war_of_manouvre_desc: "Frontal assaults of any kind are quite frankly plain idiotic. By out-maneuvering our enemies instead of just fighting them head-on, we will always be in a better position to decimate their numbers. We should also always be two steps ahead of them by increasing the speed of our divisions."
WTS_watson_concoction_x: "Watson Concoction X"
WTS_watson_concoction_x_desc: "Before she became Regent, Amelia Watson was famous for developing the 'Watson Concoction,' a wonderful little drug that helped heal and replenish soldiers on the frontline. Since becoming Regent, Amelia now has access to much more resources than before; perhaps a revision of the old Concoction is in order, to make its effects even greater..."
WTS_jfc_fullers_reforms: "Fuller's Reforms"
WTS_jfc_fullers_reforms_desc: "We should recruit the great J. F. C. Fuller. His designs of new and innovative weapons would greatly help us in any future struggles we find ourselves in."
WTS_bring_generals_out_of_retirement: "Bring the Boys out of Retirement"
WTS_bring_generals_out_of_retirement_desc: "We should recruit EVERYONE!"
WTS_homeland_renewal_act: "Homeland Revival Act"
WTS_homeland_renewal_act_desc: "We need more fighting men, and trained and ready at that. By increasing morale throughout the nation, we can expect men already with experience to come out of hiding - and by keeping that morale high into actual combat we'll ensure they can fight for even longer."
WTS_rapid_army_expansion: "Rapid Remilitarisation"
WTS_rapid_army_expansion_desc: "Even with the best of our nation already in service, more men for the front lines is always going to be needed. We need to search far and wide for those still willing to fight, even if they aren't the smartest of the bunch, and train them quickly to ensure they're up to scratch with the rest of our army."
WTS_overwhelming_force: "Overwhelming Push"
WTS_overwhelming_force_desc: "Through sheer force of will alone, our men will be able to push the enemy back."
WTS_infantry_focus: "The Infantry Push"
WTS_infantry_focus_desc: "And when we've pushed them back, we won't stop there, we'll keep pushing them until we've won!"
WTS_expand_guards_regiment: "Expand the Guards Corps"
WTS_expand_guards_regiment_desc: "Above all else, we need elite units that will defend this previous land to the very last man. To protect our country, our Queen, and our way of life - that is what these guards stand for."
WTS_tank_specialization: "Tank Specialization"
WTS_tank_specialization_desc: "Armoured units will always be more efficient at dealing with enemy infantry, and god forbid we have to go up against other tanks we'll at least have our own to defend the rest of our divisions."
WTS_quality_tanks: "Indestructible Tanks"
WTS_quality_tanks_desc: "Let's not just stop at the bare essential tanks. While their firepower will always prove to be effective, it's their hull that will stay a constant issue going forward. We must make them harder, stronger, more indestructible!"
WTS_medium_tanks_investment: "Heavier Tanks"
WTS_medium_tanks_investment_desc: "While we can always continue to improve the simple light tank design, it'll be more beneficial in the long run if we start to venture into medium and heavy innovations. "
WTS_tank_radios: "Tank Radios"
WTS_tank_radios_desc: "Having fully invested our time and efforts into armoured divisions, it would seem we have discovered hidden fruits of labor. Experimental radios that will keep our tanks on the edge in battle."
WTS_revive_the_fleet: "Revive the Fleet"
WTS_revive_the_fleet_desc: "For a nation that has so much seafaring tradition in its long history, the current state of our navy looks utterly pitiful in comparison. Thus, for us to restore Britannia, we must also restore what made it strong in the first place; its naval supremacy."
WTS_a_smaller_revival: "A Practical Expansion"
WTS_a_smaller_revival_desc: "While in previous times, yes, we were indeed the Kings of the sea - modern trade and warfare shows us now that a sizable fleet really is unnecessary. We should only keep our Navy modest and affordable going forward."
WTS_submarine_investment: "Modernize the Subs"
WTS_submarine_investment_desc: "In recent years submarines have proven to be the new, smaller innovation of the sea. If other nations even attempt to build a larger fleet than us we'll be in a position to wreak havoc from the safety of the depths."
WTS_revive_the_grand_fleet: "Britannia Rules the Waves!"
WTS_revive_the_grand_fleet_desc: "Our grandest legacy is that of the legions of warships that were scattered throughout every corner of the globe. We are nothing if we aren't to continue and honour that legacy, thus nothing shy of the grandest fleet in the world should be our ambition!"
WTS_cruiser_investments: "Modernize our Cruisers"
WTS_cruiser_investments_desc: "Regardless of the size and use of our fleet, cruisers have an extremely versatile design that can accomplish almost anything. We should invest in them to generally flesh out our fleets."
WTS_new_battleship_technology: "Modernize the Battleships"
WTS_new_battleship_technology_desc: "Just like our grand warships of old, Battleships are the more modern and far more dangerous innovations of the grand titans of the sea that strike fear into the hearts of men. To honour where we have come from, these should be our focus."
WTS_screening_emphasis: "Decisive Victory"
WTS_screening_emphasis_desc: "Regardless of the approach we have taken to expand our fleet and the designs we have implemented, we should now take steps to teach them new techniques and maneuvers. Our enemies won't see our strategies coming."
WTS_royal_marines: "The Royal Marines"
WTS_royal_marines_desc: "Any invasion into Europe from our end will be extremely difficult. Investing in specialized Marines divisions will go a long way in satiating these issues, as well as granting us troops trained against the disadvantages of rivers."
WTS_study_battle_of_athens: "Study the Battle of Athens"
WTS_study_battle_of_athens_desc: "The Battle of Athens can teach us a lot about how to further improve the attacking capabilities and organization of our Marines."
WTS_expand_the_shipyards: "Expand Shipbuilding Capabilities"
WTS_expand_the_shipyards_desc: "There's no way around it - in order to increase the raw production output for ships we will need more shipyards nation-wide dedicated to their construction."
WTS_escort_focus: "Convoy Protection Focus"
WTS_escort_focus_desc: "If we are to protect our foregin trade we must be able to protect the convoys that accomplish said trade. Harder and stronger hulls, and dedicated ships designed to escort them."
WTS_anti_submarine_book: "Guide on Modern Naval Confrontations"
WTS_anti_submarine_book_desc: "We have found further ways to protect our convoys by increasing the speed of their retreat, as well as quicker engagement for those that wish to harm them"
WTS_bases_and_batteries: "Bases and Batteries"
WTS_bases_and_batteries_desc: "Ships of any kind can be damaged quite easily, and just to house a sizable fleet is quite taxing enough. We need to expand our current shipyards if we wish to meet these demands as well as fortifying our coasts in case of a surprise Naval invasion."
WTS_expand_the_raf: "Expand the RAF"
WTS_expand_the_raf_desc: "The Royal Air Force (RAF) has gone into complete disrepair in recent years. A lack of air bases, pilot training, and innovative plane models is leaving us in the dirt compared to other nations. We should take considerable steps to expand anything airborne."
WTS_airbase_expansion: "Airbase Expansion"
WTS_airbase_expansion_desc: "Even if we are to build up a sizable production of planes, we lack the required facilities to house and train them. Around the nation we should begin construction of new airbases."
WTS_static_anti_air: "Static Anti-Air Positions"
WTS_static_anti_air_desc: "While we are already in a natural, defensive position to help prevent against enemy invasions, we are still vulnerable to bombings from over the straits. We need anti-air to adequately defend our states."
WTS_bomber_investments: "Bomber Advancements"
WTS_bomber_investments_desc: "Destroying the enemy infrastructure is a sure-fire way to help smooth over a frontline assault. We should invest in bomber designs to do just that, and who knows, maybe it could lead to something even grander?"
WTS_royal_paratroopers: "The Paras"
WTS_royal_paratroopers_desc: "Being an island nation ourselves, we already understand the difficulties of invading another country when difficult terrain would otherwise prevent a smooth frontline. If we are to have any sort of combat in Europe we should invest in specialized Paratroopers to help solve this potential issue."
WTS_pilot_training: "Improved Pilot Training"
WTS_pilot_training_desc: "What's the point of having planes if nobody can use them? By training dedicated pilots we can ensure supremacy in the skies like no other, therefore we should begin an intensive program to teach our pilots some new tricks."
WTS_night_interception: "Improved Night Interception"
WTS_night_interception_desc: "We must intercept the enemy's planes at all cost. Even in the darkest of nights our pilots shall be trained and ready for anything."
WTS_bombing_training: "Improved Bombing Training"
WTS_bombing_training_desc: "Not only should our bombers be more versatile, but our CAS too. We should be prepared to throw absolutely anything at the enemy to thwart their attempts of an invasion, or to help us on our own."
WTS_fighter_bonus: "Britannia Rules the Skies"
WTS_fighter_bonus_desc: "We have ruled the seas for centuries - why not the skies as well? Air superiority should be our top priority, we don't want to see a single plane in the sky that doesn't bear the sigil of the prestigious RAF."
WTS_ground_pounders: "The Ground Pounder"
WTS_ground_pounders_desc: "The grandest innovation in aviation this fine nation has ever seen. The Ground Pounder - named after a controversial statement our Madame President once said, is a vast improvement on our previous strategic bomber designs that will absolutely decimate the enemies facilities."
WTS_anti_tank_methods: "Anti-Tank Weaponry"
WTS_anti_tank_methods_desc: "It's proving more obvious by the day that tanks are becoming less and less expensive to produce while becoming far more deadly. We should invest in unique, anti-tank weapons to combat these nuisances against our infantry."
WTS_employment_focus: "Full Employment"
WTS_employment_focus_desc: "Having every last citizen help contribute in some way to our economy would reap significant benefits in the long term. If one doesn't have a job, the government can provide one for them. Realistically no one should have any complaints for a wide-spread system like this if they are sufficiently paid."
WTS_guns_and_steel: "Expand State Industries"
WTS_guns_and_steel_desc: "Having defined better systems of trade and work for our country, we are finally seeing our hard efforts pay off. Industry is booming with never before seen worker turnout and production efficiency, with the military sector seeing great success in particular. The nation now has a much larger section of its output dedicated to arms production alone."
WTS_examining_our_position: "Our Place in the World"
WTS_examining_our_position_desc: "The English have always been at the forefront of the world's political and economical expectations. What example should we lead going forward? The way we see it we have two conflicting options; appeasing the backbone of our industry and production - the working class, OR, providing tax exemptions for those who hold a strong grip on our economy - the upper class. As it's always been, we can only satiate one while isolating the other."
WTS_the_government_survives: "The Government Survives!"
WTS_the_government_survives_desc: "The political turmoil has come and gone, and thanks to the tireless efforts of Regent Amelia Watson, the government has managed to weather the storm. There was light at the end of the tunnel... and she has reached it. Now it is time to ensure that it never falls back down into the tunnel again."
WTS_the_government_falls: "The Government Falls!"
WTS_the_government_falls_desc: "The worst fears of the nation have come to pass; after all the turmoil, dysfunction, and instability of the past few years, the government finally could not withstand all the pressures and has collapsed. With the nation now in despair, it now falls to Watson to bring an end to these failures... somehow."
WTS_london_conference: "The London Conference"
WTS_london_conference_desc: "The people of London have long worked and toiled, giving their utmost in service to Britain. Now that we have unified our home, and look to a bright future, let us celebrate their efforts. The people of London foremost, the people of London forever!"
WTS_look_to_the_seas: "Memories of the Empire"
WTS_look_to_the_seas_desc: "There are many of those, namely the old and wealthy, who remember the glory days of our once world-spanning Empire. Should we not try to reclaim this glory for those who have remained loyal to us through thick and thin? This is our last chance... Can we please them; the rich - the upper echelon of our nation?"
WTS_splendid_isolation: "Splendid Isolation"
WTS_splendid_isolation_desc: "All the LHS and Resistance have done is destroy our nation for their wargames. Why should we trust any of them with the future of our country? From now on, we shall stand on our own two feet once more and build an island of stability away from the destructive mind games of the world factions!"
WTS_look_to_belgrade: "A Future at Belgrade"
WTS_look_to_belgrade_desc: "Amelia Watson was brought onto power with the help of the LHS, and thus we owe it to them that our nation remains standing. Let us continue our fruitful partnership with them, united in our common goal to bring universal peace and prosperity for all."
WTS_bastion_of_resistance: "The European Bastion of the Resistance"
WTS_bastion_of_resistance_desc: "It has come to our attention that Socialism may indeed be a well thought-out system of governance. We should take steps to align ourselves with similar like-minded nations such as Aqua and her Resistance Movement. From there we could go even further by spreading our beliefs to other countries."
WTS_activate_emergency_powers: "Activate Emergency Powers"
WTS_activate_emergency_powers_desc: "The country needs order, now more than ever. Unfortunately, the near-constant bickering of Parliament does not translate well into keeping the country stable from any internal or external threats. As such, until this mess is sorted out, all of its power should be vested in the Regent to ensure that the country can continue moving forward."
WTS_find_popular_support: "Find Popular Support"
WTS_find_popular_support_desc: "It's impossible to please absolutely everyone in any nation, let alone one such as ours that has seen a great divide in recent years. Nevertheless, we must do absolutely anything in our power to appease the masses as a last ditch effort to gain as much general support as possible."
WTS_a_queen_is_found: "Establish Legitimacy"
#WTS_a_queen_is_found_desc: "There is one more crucial task to accomplish. Up until now, Amelia Watson was acting formally as head of an interim government as Regent. However, given the situation, it would be prudent to finalize once and for all who our head of state will be, or whether there should even be a Kingdom."

WTS_find_a_queen_desc: "There is one more crucial task to accomplish. Up until now, Amelia Watson was acting formally as head of an interim government as Regent. However, given the situation, it would be prudent to finalize once and for all who our head of state will be, or whether there should even be a Kingdom."
WTS_call_snap_elections: "Call Snap Elections"
WTS_call_snap_elections_desc: "We can decide the fate of our nation with a sudden election. Whichever party currently has the most support in government would likely clutch a decisive victory."
WTS_restored_faith_in_government: "Restored Faith In Government"
WTS_restored_faith_in_government_desc: "Through thick and thin we have led our inner government to a never-before-seen position of stability. Because of this unprecedented support, the people too have also discovered new-found faith in us."
WTS_another_lhs_bobby: "Another Bobby for the LHS"
WTS_another_lhs_bobby_desc: "The LHS and their conflicts should be our top priority. Any wars of theirs shall be a war for us. We should also seek to pressure and align as many non-LHS nations as possible in order to further expand the League."
WTS_colonial_outlook: "A Colonial Outlook"
WTS_colonial_outlook_desc: "Britain once held dominion over all the corners of the world, and who formed the empire on which the sun never sets. Unfortunately, it had fallen on hard times, but now we are in a position to address the former dominions of the old Empire. What should we do with them, now that Britain has returned?"
WTS_deterrence: "The Rock"
WTS_deterrence_desc: "Now that the Kingdom of Watson has taken its place in the world as an avid supporter of the Resistance Movement, it would seem we have made many, many enemies. We have to defend and fortify absolutely every last inch of this precious land from infidels! Forts, AA, and radar systems will deter any would-be attackers from hurting the Resistance, as well as dedicated militia and factories."
WTS_global_crusade_against_antis: "Re-Establish Hololive Hegemony"
WTS_global_crusade_against_antis_desc: "The Antis are a menace. That is something every Holomember can agree on. All they have done is cause mischief, misrule, and instability, poisoning our nation with their actions and undermining all we have worked for. For the sake of peace and security, we must join the global crusade against Anti forces so that they may no longer harm our values, and re-establish Hololive's foothold on the Isles."
WTS_empress_watson: "Empress Watson"
WTS_empress_watson_desc: "Throughout this crisis, Amelia Watson has been acting diligently and faithfully for our nation, and it was she who led it out of the dark pits of instability. So why should we give the executive office to another? Amelia Watson the Regent should become Amelia Watson the Empress of our United Kingdom!"
WTS_president_watson: "President Watson"
WTS_president_watson_desc: "Monarchies are old-fashioned, reactionary, and often incompatible with the people's wishes. After all, no one could agree on a monarch to crown. As a result, to prevent further instability, the United Kingdom is to be replaced with a United Republic, to ensure that the people be given a direct say over their leaders in government."
WTS_constitutional_queen: "A Constitutional Monarch"
WTS_constitutional_queen_desc: "Long has the throne of the United Kingdom been empty, but no longer. After many long months, our Regent has finally found a capable monarch to rule our nation again, continuing the status quo that had worked for most of our country's history. With the country's instability finally taken care of, may our new monarch bring newfound prosperity and stability to our country!"
