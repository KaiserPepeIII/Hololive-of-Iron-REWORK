COC_kiryu_coco: "Kiryu Coco"
COC_kiryu_coco_desc: "Kiryu Coco is the iron willed and iron fisted dictator of the American Deep South and one of the primary founders of the Resistance. Her brand of Hololive Resistance ideology differs from Aqua's revolutionary ideals; Coco's belief of national corporatism and use of global crime syndicates to further the Resistance's global influence often puts her at odds with hardline revolutionary Resistance ideologues. Coco is also the creator and primary grower of the global superdrug asacoco. She believes in putting the Hololive Idol first and foremost at politics, and fights for the rights of her fellow idols worldwide.\n\nCoco was originally a firm believer in the LHS and Yagoo's idealism but lost her way and was stabbed in the back following the end of the Great War. Although Coco did a bulk of the fighting in North America and controlled a majority of the former United States, her gains were not fully recognized by the LHS and the former United States was balkanized amongst Hololivers participating in the North American Theater. The betrayed Coco found an ally in Aqua where they formed the Resistance together, but Coco's involvement in global organized crime, distribution and production of Asacoco, and her nationalist viewpoints on Resistance ideology began to create a rift with Aqua.\n\nKiryu Coco's Cocofederated States is currently the strongest nation in North America with a strong hand in Mexico as well. She plans to conquer and reunite America under the Kiryu Clan banner and spread her brand of Resistance ideology around the world. As its stands, Coco must make a choice to tolerate Aqua's Resistance revolutionary views to take down the greater threat of Yagooism, or split off from the mainline Resistance to pursue her dream of Idol Nationalism."

coco.1.t: "Yagoo Backs Kanata"
coco.1.d: "As the occupation of Northern Mexico continued, tensions only worsened. Yagoo and the LHS had announced their support of Kanata. This was followed by Yagoo demanding that we end our occupation of Kanata's land, or we will face the consequences."
coco.1.a: "We've clearly misjudged the situation"
coco.1.b: "Does he think he could stop us!?"

coco.2.t: "Kanata Backs Down"
coco.2.d: "The occupation of Veracruz appeared to pay off as she sent a message saying that she will repay our debts, under the condition that we return her territories."
coco.2.a: "We'll return the land as promised"
coco.2.b: "And if we don't?"

coco.3.t: "Aqua Backs Kanata"
coco.3.d: "By this point the Veracruz Crisis had attracted the eyes of many nations within the American sphere and across the globe as well. The thought that only the LHS would protest our actions was proven wrong as in a surprise twist, Aqua and the left-resistance had demanded that we withdraw from Veracruz."
