MIK_sakura_miko: "Sakura Miko"
MIK_sakura_miko_desc: "Sakura Miko is the “elite” queen of Spain and an aristocrat through and through. Despite her questionable intelligence at times, her sense of humour and unifying authority has prevented Spain from entering a civil war multiple times. The right regard Miko as a traditionalist authority figure that keeps the stability of the nation, while the left considers Miko a queen of the people who spearheaded multiple farming initiatives that alleviated the Great Depression, and pushed for workers rights.\n\nDespite being a queen, Sakura Miko's beginnings were rather humble; she lived with a peasant family on arrival to the past and worked as a farmhand with them. When the Great War broke out and the Hololive Revolution began, she heeded Yagoo's call to arms and joined as a leading figure in the revolutionary forces in Spain. She mostly spent her time robbing banks to build her wealth and accidentally starting fires wherever she went however. A great power vacuum occurred in Spain post-Brugg, and with both Miko's charisma, right timing and a good amount of LHS assistance she took control of the Spanish Republic. Miko re-wrote the constitution that made her queen of Spain, which aligned her with the right but quickly alienated the left. She made concessions to the left by initiating socialist policies that genuinely aided the poor, and she became the uniting figure of both sides of the aisle.\n\nSpain currently sits rather stable in the world, but Sakura Miko was suddenly struck by a mysterious illness and put into a coma. Without the guidance of their queen, the opposing forces of Spanish politics are beginning to draw their swords at each other once again. Nevertheless, both sides agree that to go to war is to betray the trust of the Elite Queen and as such, they both sit and build power in the background while awaiting for Miko to awake from her slumber."

miko.1.t: "Suisei interference in our internal politics"
miko.1.d: "Oh Elite Queen, we have confirmed reports of external influence on our polit…oh uh, Suisei is telling lies about us, bad ones and people are listening to them is the worst part!"
miko.1.a: "What? Stay home!"

miko.2.t: "Suisei offers pact of non-aggression"
miko.2.d: "Elite Queen, we have received a diplomatic request for an official, mutual Pact of Non-Aggression from Suisei. It would seem that her interests align elsewhere and she would seek security in not having to worry about us. Though this also means, we would be safe from her ire in the near future. This of course also means we will not be able to focus our attention on her either but this could be a good thing… right?"
miko.2.a: "I don’t really get it but ok!"
miko.2.b.: "FAQ!"

miko.3.t: "Suisei formally offers alliance"
miko.3.d: "Ah, Elite Queen! A particularly interesting offer has arrived from Suisei. She offers us a bond of friendship and an alliance between the nations! With a strong ally at our side, we should be safe from threats near and far. We would, however, be expected to help with whatever Suisei does. We will follow what you decide."
miko.3.a: "OK!"
miko.3.b: "No."

miko.4.t: "Suisei sends an insult!"
miko.4.d: "“I was expecting nothing from Miko’s diplomacy and I’m still disappointed. If I had one wish in life it would be when it ends, Miko presides over my funeral so she can let me down one last time.” … Elite Queen now I know this looks bad but…"
miko.4.a: "FAQ!"
miko.4.b: "This means war!"

miko.5.t: "Suisei is demanding Catalonia!"
miko.5.d: "Big problem Elite Queen! We’ve received demands from Suisei for the immediate surrender of Catalonia. This is very bad, she’s threatening war if we say no. Do we give up the land or are we prepared to fight for it? Do you think we can win or is it too much? What shall we do?"
miko.5.a: "…Fine. We can’t fight now."
miko.5.b: "Never!"

miko.6.t: "The Morrocco Question"
miko.6.d: "Elite Queen! We have received a missive from Suisei with an invite to the diplomatic table over the future of Morocco. This could mean a chance to easily secure our position in North Africa but we’d likely be seen as co-conspirators with Suisei in doing so. Still, this is a good opportunity to connect our colonies or perhaps more."
miko.6.a: "I don’t think we should."
miko.6.b: "Yes of course!"

miko.7.t: "What should our claims be?"
miko.7.d: ""
miko.7.a: "We want all of Morocco...including the Rif!"
miko.7.b: "We want all of Morocco...Miko can keep the Rif"
miko.7.c: "We only want a sphere of influence"


miko.8.t: "What should our claims be?"
miko.8.d: "Elite Queen! Our turn has arrived at the table, the question of the day however, is what our demands are for the fate of Morocco."
miko.8.a: "Morocco will be ours!"
miko.8.b: "We need to connect the Rif to Western Sahara, we don’t want to push too hard."
miko.8.c: "As long as we can get what we want from Morocco, that will do."


miko.9.t: "Results of Negotiations..."
miko.9.d: "Elite Queen, here are the results of the negotiations."
miko.9.a: "Ah, it looks like we can’t agree."
miko.9.b: "Suisei can have Morocco but the Rif is ours!"
miko.9.c: "Suisei can have Morocco but she owes us for this."
miko.9.f: "This isn’t working. We’re leaving."
miko.9.e: "It would seem that Morocco has given both of us our demands."
miko.9.e_suisei: "Our partition of Morocco goes through..."
miko.9.g: "Morocco is ours!"
miko.9.h: "We shall connect the colonies!"

miko.12.t: "Morocco caves to demands!"
miko.12.d: "Elite Queen, good news! Morocco has given in to our reasonable demands. Effective immediately we will be able to conduct our business as we see fit within their territory."
miko.12.a: "OK!"

miko.13.t: "Morocco refuses to yield."
miko.13.d: "Elite Queen, it would seem that despite everything Morocco continues to hold on to some vague notion of resistance. I don’t think I need to explain much further but given the demands we set, the only real option to rectify.. To fix this is… physically."
miko.13.a: "Ok, let's go then."

miko.14.t: "Morocco cedes territory!"
miko.14.d: "Elite Queen, good news! Morocco has understood the folly of its situation and has folded to our demands. The territory we demanded in North Africa now belongs to us! Most glorious news indeed!"
miko.14.a: "OK!"

miko.15.t: "Morocco refuses demands!"
miko.15.d: "Elite Queen, it would seem those in charge of Morocco do not understand their position. They have refused all demands and are preparing their defence. Whilst this is a justifiable excuse for war, there may be more problems if we continue the path of war now. What do you decide?"
miko.15.a: "They will wish they hadn’t done this."
miko.15.b: "Now isn’t the time."
