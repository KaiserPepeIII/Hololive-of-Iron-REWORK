#Suisei Election
holo_elections.1.t: "Snap Elections Begin!"
holo_elections.1.d: "In order to decide the fate of her country, Suisei has called for snap elections to commence. Already people are lining up at their nearest polling stations, and casting their votes to determine which party shall take office."
holo_elections.1.a: "It's so exciting!"

holo_elections.2.t: "Election Violence!"
holo_elections.2.d: "It seems that the calling for snap elections has revealed just how divided along political lines our society is. Across the country, we are getting reports of political protests and rallies being disrupted by radical groups, as well as other instances of violence as a result of political divisions."
holo_elections.2.a: "It's evidently the fault of the conservatives..."
holo_elections.2.b: "It's evidently the fault of the nationalists..."
holo_elections.2.c: "Both are to blame..."
holo_elections_2_tooltip: "The Queen's opinion of the matter will undoutedly change the results of the elections..."

holo_elections.4.t: "Conservative Landslide!"

holo_elections.4.a: "The gamble has paid off!"

holo_elections.5.t: "Nationalist Landslide!"
holo_elections.5.d: "To the surprise of some, the nationalists have gained a major victory in the elections. With their support of Aqua's resistance and opposition for Yagoo's policies, many wonder on what their ascension to power will mean for the nation and its relationship with the LHS."
holo_elections.5.a: "I guess people prefered the old government..."

holo_elections.6.t: "Resistance Coalition!"
holo_elections.6.d: "Shocking news in the political arena. A coalition between the leftwing Revolutionaries and rightwing Nationalist parties has been formed.

holo_elections.7.t: "Leading Coalition Partner?"

holo_elections.8.t: "LHS Coalition!"

holo_elections.10.t: "Monarchist Coalition!"
holo_elections.10.d: "In a shocking turn of events, the pro-monarchist elements have formed a coalition government.

Now, the queen, Suisei, finds herself with more power than she did since the rise of the Conservatives."
holo_elections.10.a: "Vive la Reine!"

holo_elections.11.t: "Leading Coalition Partner?"
holo_elections.11.d: "As Suisei finds herself once again in control of her nation's fate, she must decide on which Coalition partner will lead the country."
holo_elections.11.a: "LHS guidance has proven effective"
holo_elections.11.b: "The Resistance is the way forward"
holo_elections.11.c: "Bipartisan politics? Not in La Reine's regime!"

#Starting events
suisei.1.t: "Conservative Party Faction Breaks Off"

suisei.1.a: "This is stupid"

suisei.2.t: "Progressive Surge"
suisei.2.d: "Within the political arena, there has been a surge of support for the progressive deals of the Coalition Uni de Travailleurs. Not since the election of 1928 had the CUT seen much popularity amongst the ordinary people, despite opposition from more conservative elements within the country."
suisei.2.a: "Vive les Travailleurs!"

suisei.3.t: "Parlimentarian Scandal"
suisei.3.d: "For the past 17 years since the revolution, Suisei had led her territories in the South of France and abroad. While many know her as the paramilitary leader crowned Empress, few knew of her past prior to her ascension of power. An anonymous source had leaked records and statements, claiming that Suisei had once led a gang that committed various crimes including racketeering and theft. All this after her release in 1910 for her previous crimes. When asked about this, the Empress merely said, “so I was a criminal in my past life. What happened then is irrelevant."
suisei.3.a: "Seriously?"

suisei.4.t: "Royalist Surge"
suisei.4.d: "The vast popularity Suisei has gotten over the years has culminated in increased support for her to regain more power as queen. Although opposed by many political parties apart from the monarchists, the surge in monarchist sentiment is something that simply cannot be ignored by the other parties."
suisei.4.a: "Vive Suisei la Reine!"

suisei.5.t: "Formation of the Society for Suisei"
suisei.5.d: "In order to spread the word and appreciation of our beloved Reine, a society dedicated solely to her has been formed. Not only have they begun making art and films to honour her, but members of the Society for Suisei have begun travelling beyond our borders, to spread their message world wide."
suisei.5.a: "Now even those abroad will know of our oshi!"

suisei.6.t: "France Issues Diplomatic Protest"
suisei.6.d: "Our recent actions have drawn the attention of our rivals to the north. As a result, the government in Paris has issued a diplomatic protest. We can either give into their demands, or hold our ground."
suisei.6.a: "Give into their demands"
suisei.6.b: "We will not let a false nation dictate our policies!"

suisei.7.t: "Yagoo Demands Withdrawal from France"
suisei.7.d: "As our armies push north towards Paris, Yagoo and a number of LHS countries have been alarmed by our aggression. As a result, they have demanded that we withdraw from France, ending the war as quickly as possible."
suisei.7.a: "Capitulate to demands"
suisei.7.b: "Never! We shall be whole again!"

suisei.8.t: "Strikes!"
suisei.8.d: "The strain on our economy has become too much to bear resulting in workers nationwide to go out on strike. As a result, our economy has gone into a standstill, and will remain so until we can end the strikes."
suisei.8.a: "Merde!"

suisei.9.t: "The French Resistance Strikes"
suisei.9.d: "Ever since the division of France, there have been elements within our country that have dedicated themselves to reuniting with the rest of France. Now, due to recent events, we have seen an escalation in activity from the French Resistance, hoping to disrupt the country and reunite with the north"
suisei.9.a: "We need to organise a crackdown"
suisei.9.b: "Bah, free speech is more important than a few thugs"

suisei.10.t: "LHS Investment Offer"
suisei.10.d: "The LHS has offered to financially invest in our country. While this will boost our economy, pro-resistance elements in our country fervently oppose the deal."
suisei.10.a: "We gladly accept"
suisei.10.b: "Merde, we are fine on our own!"

suisei.25.t: "The Question of La Reine"
suisei.25.d: "Many within Parliament have begun questioning the role La Reine must play within our country. Some say that she remains as a figurehead, while her advisors and parliament do most of the work, while others have suggested more extreme measures. Left-wing elements say she should have her position of monarchy abolished, while the royalists demand she be given more power over the government."
suisei.25.a: "An interesting idea..."

#Suisei Strikes#
suisei_deal_with_strikes: "Deal with §SStrikers§!"
suisei_deal_with_strikes_desc: "Cities all around Southern France are in gridlock as people who have recently lost their jobs to the depression have taken to the streets to protest the government's inaction. We have the option of dispersing them here and now but that is likely to be extremely unpopular, result in a rise of French Resistance and likely lose us our position in parliament."
suisei.11.t: "The Strikes Continue!"
suisei.11.d: "Despite our negotiations, the Strikers still refuse to return to work, making more demands before fully being ready to end the strike"
suisei.11.a: "Negotiations will continue regardless!"

suisei.13.t: "The Strikers Push for One More Demand!"
suisei.13.d: "Just as negotiations were making a breakthrough, the strikers have made one more demand before agreeing to our terms."
suisei.13.a: "If it gets them back into the workplace..."
suisei.13.b: "Enough of this nonsense. Call in the army!"

suisei.14.t: "The Protests Die Down"
suisei.14.d: "We have finally reached a breakthrough with the strikers. In return for safer working conditions, reasonable hours, and decent pay, they will be returning to their jobs. Many within the government, particularly the Socialists and Revolutionaries see this as a victory for the common workers."
suisei.14.a: "Finally"

suisei.15.t: "Aftermath of the Riots"
suisei.15.d: "After negotiations with the strikers fail, the army has been called in to assist the police in breaking up the strikes. After days of intense violence, the strikes are now over. However, while some praise order being restored, many within parliament and ordinary citizens have criticised the government for violently cracking down on simple calls for better working conditions. Left-leaning parties in particular believe that this was an abuse of power."
suisei.15.a: "Merde..."

suisei.16.t: "Looting and Rioting!"
suisei.16.d: "The strikes have now devolved into widespread riots and looting across nearly all major cities across the country. As police deal with them as best to their ability, members of the government are demanding action be taken. "
suisei.16.a: "Let's hope it doesn't get worse"

suisei.18.t: "Utilize §PRoyal Powers?§!"
suisei.18.d: "As chaos grips the country, more and more people as well as members of parliament are pleading for Suisei to use her royal powers and intervene, and hopefully end the chaos. However, some criticise this motion, saying that it will bring an end to democracy for the sake of putting an end to the riots across the country."
suisei.18.a: "Of course! Allons Suisei!"
suisei.18.b: "§lDemocracy§! will not die in France!"

suisei.19.t: "À Où?"
suisei.19.d: "A"
suisei.19.a: "Needless to say, the §dLHS§! has supported us depite our recent troubles."
suisei.19.b: "Aqua's §DResistance§! is the way of the future..."
suisei.19.c: "Partisan politics?! Dans le pays de §Pla Reine§!!?"

suisei.20.t: "Reuniting With Brothers"
suisei.20.d: "With the end of the idol Suisei's reign, many within our country now demand that we reunite with the rest of our French brothers to the north."
suisei.20.a: "Is this even a question?"
suisei.20.b: "Non! Les fronts noir and bleus have abandoned us!"

suisei.21.t: "The Protectorate of Algeria declares independence!"
suisei.21.d: "We have recently got word that the Protectorate of Algeria has declared independence from us. Being our prized colony, many have been shocked as a result of Algeria leaving our empire, and many are demanding action being taken."
suisei.21.a: "We have bigger fish to fry..."
suisei.21.b: "We'll be back before they know it."

suisei.22.t: "The Algerian Question?"
suisei.22.d: "Ever since Algeria declared independence, many from average citizens to high ranking members of parliament have wondered what should be done."
suisei.22.a: "What are you waiting for?! Attack!"
suisei.22.b: "Another War? I'd rather an amical relationship."

suisei.23.t: "Our Southern Brothers Request Annexation"
suisei.23.d: "Ever since the idol who proclaimed herself queen of the south was overthrown, many speculate what would happen to her former kingdom. We now have gotten a message from there, as the antis who overthrew Suisei ask that we annex the Southern regions, reuniting France as a result."
suisei.23.a: "Is this a question? Of course let them in!"
suisei.23.b: "Communism is a greater threat than the LHS!"

suisei.24.t: "Our Northern Brothers Accept!"
suisei.24.d: "Wonderful news! Our brothers in the north have accepted our request for annexation. Now, France will be whole again!"
suisei.24.a: "Of Course? Why wouldn't they?"


suisei.26.t: "Progressive-Conservative Coalition Shatters"
suisei.26.d: "Divisions within the coalition proved to be too great for all parties. As a result, the coalition has completely dissolved, with both the Conservatives and Progressive factions going about their separate ways once more."
suisei.26.a: "Merde!"

suisei.27.t: "End of the Depression?"
suisei.27.d: "With our economic situation improving, many within the government believe the economic depression is now over. While some are willing to move onto more pressing issues, others within parliament believe that we should change our economy to lessen the effects of another depression."
suisei.27.a: "Proof capitalism isn't at fault"

suisei.28.t: "Budget Proposals - Day 1"
suisei.28.d: "The drafting of new reforms to our economic budget has begun. First on the to-do list is a new proposal on reforming our healthcare and education system. While conservative elements argue for maintaining the current system, progressive elements are demanding that it be made universal for all citizens"
suisei.28.a: "Healthcare and Education are rights!"
suisei.28.b: "Surely the conservatives see the benefits of a bit of spending?"
suisei.28.c: "We don't want to anger our coalition partners..."

suisei.29.t: "Budget Proposals - Day 2"
suisei.29.d: "Day 2 of the new budget proposals. Now comes a more controversial subject in the form of expanding our country's military. While some, mainly the pro-LHS parties advocate for us to either remain neutral in global affairs or to abide by the Brugg Treaty, while Pro-resistance parties advocate for expansion, regardless of if they abide by the Brugg treaty or not."
suisei.29.a: "We agree, it's a dangerous world after all..."
suisei.29.b: "The limitations set by Brugg are a good standard"
suisei.29.c: "Sacrébleu! We are pacifists at heart!"

suisei.30.t: "Budget Proposals - Day 3"
suisei.30.d: "Final day of the budget proposals, and what needs to be discussed is a way to help cope with the effects of the depression. Some parties, mainly those who are conservative say that no intervention should be taken, or for only limited programs to be implemented, while other parties call for a full stimulus package."
suisei.30.a: "Stimulous is the way out of the depression!"
suisei.30.b: "Small programs are sufficient"
suisei.30.c: "Just another concession to make..."

suisei.31.t: "The Budget is Drafted!"
suisei.31.d: "After days of proposals, the final budget has been drafted. As we prepare to implement the budget's changes nationwide, we are keeping an eye out on the reactions to it from the various political parties."
suisei.31.a: "Hopefully we won't start a riot..."

suisei.32.t: "Anger from the Right!"
suisei.32.d: "Unfortunately it seems that the new budget has drawn the anger from many right leaning and conservative groups, who believe the new budget is too left leaning. Already protests have erupted in the streets, demanding for the budget to be changed."
suisei.32.a: "Damn Conservatives!"

suisei.33.t: "Agreement from All Sides!"
suisei.33.d: "To the surprise of many, it seems that everyone on the political spectrum, conservative, socialist, nationalist and monarchist has agreed with the policies of the recent budget"
suisei.33.a: "A win for the government!"

suisei.34.t: "Pinacle of the Enlightened Monarch"
suisei.34.d: "Although many feared reprisal for suggesting Suisei's power be limited or removed entirely, to the surprise of many, La Reine Suisei has allowed many of the opposing parties to remain, and she has even gone as far as to allow some members of parliament from different parties to maintain their positions."
suisei.34.a: "Rule through respect, not force"

suisei.35.t: "White Terror"
suisei.35.d: "Unfortunately it seems the fears of many politicians have come true as in order to ensure the security of our country's people and La Reine, a systematic purge has begun of all enemies of La Reine Suisei. Already, we have begun dismissing rival politicians from parliament, and our police are out hunting supposed enemies among our citizenry."
suisei.35.a: "Only la Reine shall rule!"

suisei.36.t: "Resistance Supporters Defect"
suisei.36.d: "Our policies seemed to have angered pro-resistance elements within our country. As a result, many have fled abroad, defecting to more friendly nations world wide."
suisei.36.a: "Damn!"

suisei.37.t: "Anger from our Supporters!"
suisei.37.d: "Dissent among our own supporters has been steadily growing thanks to our recent policies. As our popularity among the ordinary people wanes, our government is preparing for more civil unrest, should things escalate."
suisei.37.a: "At least our partners are satisfied"

suisei.79.t: "Policy with Miko"

suisei.39.b: "Forget it"

suisei.40.t: "Miko refuses"
suisei.40.d: "Despite requesting the peaceful handover of Catalonia even in the face of war breaking out, Miko has refused to hand it over to us.

suisei.40.a: "Declare war!"
suisei.40.b: "We are not ready"


suisei.41.t: "Italian Rebels"

suisei.46.a: "This is gonna be a long occupation…"

suisei.42.t: "Swiss Rebels"
suisei.42.d: "News from the tall and rugged mountains of Switzerland. Our garrisons have been attacked, and infrastructure around the country has been sabotaged, making our efforts to traverse and control the region even more difficult."
suisei.42.a: "This is gonna be a long occupation…"

suisei.43.t: "Suisei Transfers Land"

suisei.49.d: "It appears that the reforms implemented by the nationalists have been reaping some good results. While some are sceptical, others firmly believe that the nationalists have succeeded in changing the country for the best, as part of their policy for shaping a proud nation."
suisei.49.a: "A great nation produces great results!"

suisei.50.t: "Revolutionary Reforms Succeed"

suisei.70.d: "Today, March 22nd, marks the anniversary of Suisei's revolution against the French Government. As soldiers parade through the streets, people cheer at the sight of them, and then at the sight of La Reine Suisei as she waves to the crowd from her carriage. As she got to the balcony of her palace, she made a speech, proclaiming that as queen, she will do whatever it takes, to liberate the French people from the corruption of the government in Paris."
suisei.70.a: "Vive La Revolution! Vive La Reine!"

Despite our claims to the North, many governments around the world have announced a 'Two-France' policy and have recognized the government in Paris as the legitimate owners of their de-facto territory. This is a grave insult to our country which for years have fought for French re-unification.\n\nHowever, there is still time to act. The fledgeling government to the North has many enemies within and much of the population would support re-unification; even under Suisei's reign."

Despite our claims to the North, some governments around the world have announced a 'Two-France' policy and have recognized the government in Paris as the legitimate owners of their de-facto territory. The LHS and Subaru have gone against this and have insisted that the seizure of power in the North was illegal. Troops from The Lowlands have already crossed the border regions with the aim of seizing Paris. If given their way, the LHS will shape France in their own image and be opposed to our attempts of re-unification.\n\nHowever, there is still time to act.

suisei.91.t: "Miko Refuses Negotiations"
suisei.91.d: "In an odd turn of events, Miko's representatives have announced their disinterest in negotiating over the issue of Morocco. With no other powers seeming to take interest in the matter, we essentially have been granted a free hand over the country."

suisei.95.d: "Before coming to power, France was on the brink of total collapse. Poverty was rising, prices for food and rent were skyrocketing, and factories laid empty as workers strike for better pay. To avoid more chaos, the newly elected Yagooist government had begun enacting a series of emergency measures to get the economy back on track."
suisei.95.a: "Time to get to work."

suisei.97.t: "Unrest Picks Up"
suisei.97.d: "News has come from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs that there has been a recent uptick of violence in the colonies.

suisei.98.d: "News has come from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs that there has been a recent uptick of violence in the colonies.

suisei.99.d: "News has come from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs that there has been a recent uptick of violence in the colonies.

suisei.106.d: "The civilian government in Paris today has announced the complete transfer of territory and power to the National Government, finally putting an end to over 15 years of military occupation. Officials and those who collaborated with the Occupation Government have all either fled or been persecuted by the new French government. Naturally, such an upset to the status quo has brought the ire of the LHS and Subaru who led the bulk of the occupation efforts. Pro-LHS forces have already marched into Picardie and the Ardennes regions. If given their way, the LHS will shape France in their own image and be opposed to our attempts of re-unification.\n\nHowever, there is still time to act.

For such a sudden event, Subaru, who led the bulk of the LHS occupation efforts, has announced that her armed forces will not be deployed to reinstall the Occupation Government.\n\nHere presents a perfect opportunity to reunify our country under one banner.

suisei.107.b: "We will return"

suisei.108.t: "Negotiations with Subaru"
suisei.108.d: "As the saying goes, to the victor go the spoils. With the false French nation having been vanquished, it was up to La Reine and Subaru to redraw the map. Subaru has insisted on creating a northern puppet regime in Northern France to act as a buffer state between our two countries, which would go against our claims to the entirety of France as per the pre-Great War borders. Pressing our territorial claims is of the utmost importance during the negotiations but we should also not make an enemy out of one of the world's Great Powers."
suisei.108.a: "All of france belongs to la Reine!"

suisei.110.t: "Subaru Refuses to Back Down"
suisei.110.d: "Suisei is disappointed to hear the news that Subaru has refused to acknowledge any claims beyond the Seine river, including the prized city of Paris.

suisei.111.a: "So be it"

suisei.112.t: "Subaru Stays in the War"
suisei.112.d: "Recently the Lowland state of Calais has fell to our forces. Our brothers who have been separated from us since 1919 have been reintegrated into our revived French nation. Subaru has decided to stay in the war in hope that the tide of war will turn in her favour."

suisei.113.t: "Total victory against the duck"
suisei.113.d: "Despite backing from the LHS and a seemingly more organised army, Subaru's forces were completely annihilated by the might and co-ordination of the French Army. This resulted in Subaru unconditionally surrendering her French territories, with the new border being drawn at Wallonia. For the first time in decades, France is a united nation again."
suisei.113.a: "A glorious day for La Reine!"

suisei.114.t: "France Has Capitulated"
suisei.114.d: "After a string of major defeats the illegitimate Northern government has capitulated to us.

suisei.115.t: "France Has Capitulated"
suisei.115.d: "After a string of major defeats the illegitimate Northern government has capitulated to us.

suisei.116.t: "Subaru Hands Over Paris"
suisei.116.d: "In a public statement, Subaru has announced that the city of Paris alongside neighby strategic towns and villages will be handed over to our country. While not a total re-unification, control over Paris is a major step in the right direction of achieving our pre-1919 borders."

suisei.117.d: "In a public statement, Subaru has announced that all French lands that were effectively ruled by the Occupation Government from 1919 to its recent dissolution will be handed over to our country.

#French Capitulation
suisei.118.t: "Subaru Surrenders"
suisei.118.d: "After a series of successful advances into the pro-Subaru satellite state to the North, the false French government has finally decided to capitulate. Following this news, Subaru herself has announced that hostilities will cease between our countries and that the Foch Agreement signed in 1919 will be revised to include the lands of the former French Occupation Zone. This revision fails to include the territory of Calais but nevertheless it recognizes our government as the unchallenged successor to the Third Republic."

#French Capitulation + Calais
suisei.119.t: "Subaru Surrenders"
suisei.119.d: "After a series of successful advances into the Lowland territory of Calais, Subaru has finally decided to surrender. Subaru followed up this announcement by renouncing the Foch Agreement signed in 1919 and has begrudgingly recognized the pre-Great War borders of metropolitan France as the rightful borders of our state. This finally places us as the unchallenged successor to the Third Republic."

suisei.120.d: "Following our successful skirmish into the pro-Subaru French satellite state, Subaru has offered to hand over the city of Paris and neighbouring towns and villages in exchange for an end to hostilities.

#Paris skirmish lose
suisei.121.t: "Paris in Enemy Hands!"
suisei.121.d: "Things have only gone downhill since our incursion into the pro-Subaru French satellite state. Our forces have failed to make significant progress on the frontlines and the strategic objective of the city of Paris has remained in enemy hands. It is clear that nothing short of a major, unaffordable escalation will save our diminishing war prospects."
suisei.121.a: "Not good at all"

suisei.122.t: "Collapse of the French empire"
suisei.122.d: "Despite all of our efforts to pacify and reincorporate our African colonies into the empire, the resistance from the natives proved to be too great. Massive uprisings in various cities and guerilla attacks in the countryside had resulted in our mighty army being forced to withdraw from various positions across Africa, tasked with buying enough time for our colonial officials and citizens to escape."
suisei.122.a: "Hold Algeria at all costs!"
suisei.122.b: "Damn it! Let the savages have the land!"

suisei.123.t: "Governing our new colony"
suisei.123.d: "Our latest conquest has added a new colony to our expanding empire. But one question was on the minds of Suisei and her advisors. How do we govern it? Do we grant the natives self governance and equal rights, or do we fully exploit the resources and manpower of these lands to fuel our nation?"
suisei.123.a: "Lenient colonial rule to start good relations with the natives."
suisei.123.b: "To hell with the natives, start mining!"

suisei.124.t: "Rebirth of the French colonial empire - Rampant exploitation"
suisei.124.d: "For the first time since the Great War, much of Africa had fallen under the banner of France. In an effort to maintain control of the colonies and make France an economic powerhouse, Suisei had adopted the same policies used by the old French empire. Mass exploitation of natural resources and ruling the natives through the use of military might and fear."
suisei.124.a: "Fear will keep the Africans in line."

suisei.125.t: "Rebirth of the French colonial empire - Limited self governance"
suisei.125.d: "Once more, the banner of the French empire has been raised over the continent of Africa. However, Suisei had seemingly learned from the mistakes made by the past French government when governing her new colonies. Natives were granted equal voting and labour rights alongside white Frenchmen, institutes such as schools, hospitals and modern infrastructure were introduced and various African tribes and peoples were granted the right of limited self governance. All in an attempt to gain support among the native populations."
suisei.125.a: "They will worship La Reine for centuries."

suisei.127.t: "Irys yields"
suisei.127.d: "For years Irys ruled what was once the African nation of Liberia. Its resources and ports make it a key stronghold to controlling the West African coast and as such La Reine Suisei decided to include it as part of the empire. After sending a list of demands to Irys, Suisei was delighted to learn that Irys would accept all of them without a fight, avoiding a costly war."
suisei.127.a: "Smart choice"

suisei.128.t: "Irys refuses"
suisei.128.d: "For years Irys ruled what was once the African nation of Liberia. Its resources and ports make it a key stronghold to controlling the West African coast and as such La Reine Suisei decided to include it as part of the empire. Sending a list of demands to Irys, Suisei fell into a rage after learning that Irys had rejected the demands and announced her willingness to fight for her country's freedom."
suisei.128.a: "You have chosen death"

suisei.129.t: "Pacifying through show of force"
suisei.129.d: "While benevolence and limited self rule allowed us to gain popularity among the natives, some had not been won over by our generosity and continued to resist our rule. Since they met our efforts of peace with violence, it was only appropriate that we responded the same way. However our army did not just target the rebels in our territory, but also those who had crossed our borders and fled to former French colonies. It was thought that invading these breakaway states would both pacify these rebels and expand our empire at the same time."
suisei.129.a: "They will change their minds once they see our might."

#Cameroon from Noel
suisei.130.t: "Noel Refuses to Surrender Cameroon"
suisei.130.d: "Cameroon was originally a colony under the control of the German Empire. Once Germany was split up after the Great War, the territory was ceded to Noel who continues to own it to this day. Although not the most profitable or resource rich colony in the region, Cameroon remains a large exporter of rubber and other cash crops which could be useful for the Metropole.\n\nSuisei has long recognized these benefits. In her most recent attempt at expanding her Empire, Suisei has demanded the colony from Noel; threatening her with war. Today Noel has officially rejected Suisei's demands and has begun mobilizatipon."

suisei.132.a: "Seems like the Prussians are more bark than bite"

suisei.133.t: "Cameroon Out of Reach"
suisei.133.d: "Word has finally come back from the frontlines in West Africa. Our attempt to seize the colony by force has failed miserably. After such a terrible defeat, we are forced to sign a ceasefire with Noel; acknowledging her rightful control of the territory."

Once the war was over, it was decided that the colony was to be handed over to Fubuki.\n\nThe colony's lucrative plantation economy makes it an attractive target for La Reine. In her most recent attempt at expanding her Empire, Suisei has demanded that the Gold Coast be handed over at once. Fubuki has rejected these demands and has announced that she has every intention on retaining control of the colony."

#Ivory Coast from Subaru
suisei.142.t: "The Return of the Ivory Coast"
suisei.142.d: "Côte d'Ivoire was formerly a French colony prior to the Hololive Revolution. After Suisei's brief reign of Empress however, it was decided that La Reine could not be trusted. Côte d'Ivoire was handed over to Subaru as a protectorate who controls it to this day. Such a stain on our Queen's honour can not remain.\n\nIn her most recent attempt at reclaiming the glory of the French colonial empire, Suisei has demanded the territory be returned unconditionally.

suisei.143.t: "Yagoo Returns Our Former Colonies"
suisei.143.d: "The French colonial empire was split apart once the Great War and Suisei's reign as Empress was over.

suisei.145.a: "Oh well"

suisei.146.t: "Skirmishes on the border"
suisei.146.d: "Since the early 20th Century, Morocco had been partitioned between Spanish and French colonial rule. Due to our disagreements in the negotiations, it seems that war is the only solution to our problems. In her effort to further expand France's colonial empire, Suisei has demanded that Miko surrender the Spanish controlled Rif mountains to French colonial rule. Unsurprisingly, Miko has refused to hand over her colony to Suisei."
suisei.146.a: "Launch the surprise attack! Invade both Spain and Morocco!"

suisei.147.t: "Miko's Surrender"
suisei.147.d: "The rapid seizure of Morocco and the co-ordinated offensives across the various colonial borders has not only resulted in the deaths and capture of hundreds of Spanish troops, but also the morale among Miko's army which has plummeted. With the war seen as unwinnable, Miko's troops have begun to desert en masse, either fleeing into the countryside or surrendering to Suisei's forces rather than fight a futile last stand. Seeing no other option, Miko has sent an unconditional surrender offer to Suisei."
suisei.147.a: "Send our demands, seize all captured colonies and take all of Morocco."

suisei.148.t: "Anti-War Demonstrations"
suisei.148.d: "Despite early successes, our army had become bogged down in both the Pyrennes and Rif Mountains. With little progress on the frontlines and massive casualties, many people have begun wondering if it was worth fighting over some seemingly worthless land in Africa. Anti-war protests and riots have sprung up in the streets of various cities calling for an end to the war. More concerningly, reports began being made that soldiers on the frontline had begun deserting the army in order to escape the fighting."
suisei.148.a: "Cowards! Defend your queen and homes!"

suisei.149.t: "The Treaty of Genoa"
suisei.149.d: "After months of desertions, strategic failures and dwindling war support, La Reine has decided to capitulate to Miko's terms under the condition that the French metropole will remain intact. With Pekora as mediator, French and Spanish negotiators have agreed to the conditions that all of Morocco will be ceded to Miko, that Suisei will renounce any claims to the region, that any colonial territory occupied by Miko during the period of the war will remain under Spanish occupation, and that the border between Spain and France be demilitarized. Although these terms are humiliating, the war going on for any longer would have only further brought destruction to our nation."
suisei.149.a: "We have no choice, sign it"

suisei.150.t: "Army Desertions!"
suisei.150.d: "Huge unrest amongst our citizens and soldiers over such a war is minimizing our ability to effectively conduct the war for much longer. Our string of ill-fate has not been helped by the fact that Morocco despite all odds remains alive and kicking. Such a loss to an African nation will massively destabilize our colonies but ultimately we have no other choice than to withdraw."
suisei.150.a: "A tragic loss, how will we tell our Queen?"

suisei.151.t: "Miko Forced Out of Morocco"
suisei.151.d: "Morocco is still fighting us and contesting our control. We must take them before our willingness to fight runs out."

suisei.153.t: "A Phyrric Victory"
suisei.153.d: "After months of fighting, our armed forces have finally crushed the last bastion of Moroccon resistance. Our successes, although welcomed, is stained by the blood of tens of thousands of soldiers who died fighting in what was intended to be a small colonial war."

suisei.154.t: "End of the Conflict"
suisei.154.d: "One by one, the former colonies of the French empire have been reincoporated under Suisei's supreme rule. It is complete, the French empire has been restored to its former glory!"
suisei.154.a: "Vive la France!"

suisei.155.t: "The fall of Morocco"
suisei.155.d: "After a string of skirmishes against the weak Moroccan army, we had finally retaken our former colony. As our soldiers marched victoriously through Casablanca, some of Suisei’s generals and advisors began calling for her to demand Miko’s possessions in North Africa, potentially igniting a war between our nation and Spain."
suisei.155.a: "No, we must mantain a neutral stance on Miko for the time."
suisei.155.b: "Do it."

suisei.156.t: "Stalemate in Spain"
suisei.156.d: "Almost a year had passed since the armies of France crossed into Spain, however after some initial gains the army has made little progress. Lack of supply, the difficult terrain and the tenacity of Miko’s forces has resulted in our troops being bogged down in the mountains of Spain. As what was supposed to be a quick war dragged on, Suisei was left with two choices. Appease her people’s growing anti-war sentiment and seek a white peace with Miko, or force her generals and continue the fighting."
suisei.156.a: "This was a disaster. Seek a white peace."

suisei.157.t: "Victory in Catalonia"
suisei.157.d: "Despite devastating losses and tenacious resistance from the Spanish army, our brave troops have driven Miko’s soldiers out of Catalonia, accomplishing their goal to secure the region. However as Suisei prepares to meet with Miko to secure a formal peace, this swift victory has caused some to believe that La Reine should push further to demand more territory from Miko."
suisei.157.a: "We will demand only the transfer of Catalonia."
suisei.157.b: "We will demand the transfer of Catalonia, as well as the handover of the Balearics and Gibraltar as military bases."
suisei.157.c: "We will demand all of Aragon, as well as Gibraltar and the balearics!"

suisei.158.t: "Miko rejects our demands"
suisei.158.d: "Having won the war in Catalonia and being swayed by some of her advisors, Suisei demanded that Miko hand over not just Catalonia but other territories as well. But much to her surprise, Miko had rejected our demands and stated that her army would fight to the last man before any more Spanish territory would be surrendered."
suisei.158.a: "Advance further into Spain and pressure them to accept them."

suisei.159.t: "Spain Surrenders"
suisei.159.d: "As the last of Miko's forces surrender, the international community as well as the Yagooists have begun to condemn our actions in Spain. As such, it would probably be best not to anger them further by forcing a too heavy a peace deal on Miko. This doesn't mean however that we will let them off scot free. The peace deal that we settled on involves the transfer of Aragon to us, as well as naval bases in the Balearics and Gibraltar. Miko will also have to pay heavy war reparations to us, so the remaining parts of Spain will still be partially working to our benefit. Overall, this is the best outcome we can get without facing an intervention from outside powers."
suisei.159.a: "I expected no less."

suisei.160.t: "The Hololive Sports Festival"
suisei.160.d: "Despite the growing risk of war across Europe and the world, there was one event that seemed to unite all idols despite their differences. The annual Hololive Sports Festival was an event where idols would be placed into two teams and participate in different sporting events and challenges. For the idols, it was an occasion to have fun with their fellow idols and to win glory for their team and nations. Our hosting of such a succesful event will grant us great prestige."
suisei.160.a: "A fun event."

suisei.161.t: "Choosing a capital city"
suisei.161.d: "As our economic projects get more and more expensive, Suisei has expressed the desire to live in the Palace of Versailles as the past French Kings and Queens have. Such a move would be very costly for us, as fighting in the city would with no doubt damage Versailles and force us to rebuild it. A second plan was made up though, where we could recreate a second grander Versailles right in the city of Marseilles which has become the home of the Suifrance state. Surely, wherever our queen decides to settle will be the capital of France, the only question that remains is where?"
suisei.161.a: "Paris will be a far easier approach."
sioseo.162.b: "Marseilles has been very loyal to Suisei! It must be rewarded!"

suisei.162.t: "The rebirth of Versailles"
suisei.162.d: "Having vanquished the false government in Northern France, Suisei was ready to reclaim the city which French kings and queens had ruled for centuries. After the French army marched triumphantly through the streets of Paris, Suisei along with her troops would arrive at the Palace of Versailles, where Suisei and her ministers would begin to centralise all power in France. To the nation and the whole world this signalled not just the reunification of France, but the return of a monarchy in France, led by the self proclaimed La Reine Suisei."
suisei.162.a: "Versailles is home to a Queen once more. "

suisei.163.t: "A new Versailles"
suisei.163.d: "Ever since France called itself a nation, Paris was the centre of power. From kings to revolutionaries, Paris had always been the capital city of France. But in this new era for the country, Suisei decided that France needed a new capital. It was decided that the Mediterranean port city of Marseilles, the de facto capital city of Suisei’s nation, would become the new seat of power for all of France. Outside of the city, the Palais du Pharo would undergo renovation before it was declared as the new Palace of Versailles, to show the world that France had a new city for its government to call home."
suisei.163.a: "A new capital for a new era."

suisei.164.t: "The New Las Vegas"
suisei.164.d: "With the economy beginning to gradually rise past pre-depression levels, more and more people have begun to spend their money on things other than basic necessities. Alcohol, cars, luxury clothing and most prominently gambling. Casinos across France primarily along the French Riviera have seen a boom in customers, as people arrive to gamble their hard earned money and enjoy a luxurious night of entertainment."
suisei.164.a: "The money is flowing!!"

suisei.165.t: "Second concert of Toulouse"
suisei.165.d: "The success of Suisei’s policies to stabilise the economy and the resulting growth in wealth has caused Suisei’s popularity to soar amongst the people. To mark the occasion, Suisei decided to perform another concert at Toulouse and reward her people’s loyalty with her singing, as she did before to gain power."
suisei.165.a: "La Reine sings like an angel."

suisei.166.t: "La Reine’s big gamble"
suisei.166.d: "Suisei’s latest plan to increase revenue for the tourism industry had prompted many of her advisors to doubt the success of such a strategy. It involved the construction of numerous luxury hotels and resorts along the Mediterranean coast and French Riviera, as well as many questionable prestigious projects. While such a gamble could work, the cost of building these could possibly bankrupt the country as well if they do not have the desired effect."
suisei.166.a: "It's a high risk high reward strategy!"

suisei.167.t: "Massacre in Algeria"
suisei.167.d: "Disturbing news has arrived from North Africa. Moroccan raiders had crossed the Algerian border and attacked a nearby colonial settlement which caused the death of several civilians. Although a horrific tragedy, some believed it was a perfect opportunity to show the strength of the new government by attacking these raiders. The only problem was Miko, who opposed any entry into Morocco. Negotiating with her was necessary to bring these barbarians to justice."
suisei.167.a: "We must tread carefully during this crisis."

suisei.168.t: "Indecisive Moroccan negotiations"
suisei.168.d: "Miko refused to negotiate with us regarding our entry into Morocco, where she stated that she had no interest in preventing Suisei from entering. Despite this being a good result for us, the lack of any cooperation from Miko raises questions over what our stance on Miko should be in the future. La reine, in front of thousands of her fans as well as many cameras, decided..."
suisei.168.a: "...Miko is a dear friend of La Reine who we will work together with!"
suisei.168.a: "...Miko's inaction is proof that Miko's regime is working against the Suifrance state!"

suisei.169.t: "Suisei Denounces Miko"
suisei.169.d: "As the morocco crisis has ended, Suisei denounced Miko’s government at a rally by claiming that French authorities being stopped from intervening in Morocco was proof that Miko sheltered the bandits, and as such Miko was working to subvert Suisei's government."
suisei.169.a: "Outrageous!"

suisei.170.t: "Suisei announces cooperation"
suisei.170.d: "As the morocco crisis has ended, Suisei addressed her people at a rally. There she would announce that French colonial have enjoyed the cooperation of Miko's forces and that Suisei will work towards closer bonds between the two, even opening up the prospects of alliance."
suisei.170.a: "Thanks for the help Miko!"

suisei.171.t: "Our african colonies"
suisei.171.d: "After the Great War had ended, we inherited what remained of France’s colonial empire in Africa. This consisted of Algeria and small parts of West and Equatorial Africa. Despite being one of the largest empires in the region, maintaining control over these colonies was a daunting task for La Reine’s government. Corruption in high places of the colonial administration and constant resistance from the native Africans made it nearly impossible to exploit the natural resources of the colonies to fuel France’s economy and made some question whether or not maintaining this collapsing empire was worth the manpower and money. But despite the flaws, many still believed that Suisei’s France was destined to succeed where the old France had failed and become the dominant imperial power on the African continent."
suisei.171.a: "We shall inherit our place on the world stage."

suisei.172.t: "Unrest lightly on the Decline"
suisei.172.d: "The Ministry of Colonial Affairs have reported that our efforts in tackling unrest in the colonies have been extremely succesful, crushing and heavily setting back the insurrection. We could only hope that our luck continues."
suisei.172.a: "Thank god"
