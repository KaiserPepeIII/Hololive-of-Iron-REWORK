MEL_yozora_mel: "Yozora Mel"
MEL_yozora_mel_desc: "Yazora Mel is the brutal, pro-Pekora dictator of Romania. She rules over the country with her own party, the Yazora Guard, who maintain the rule of law with authoritarian policy. She is also known as the Banpire in the LHS due to her anti-Yagooist policies, causing her to be alienated by the entirety of the LHS and a trade embargo issued upon her country.\n\nMel was originally close to Yagoo's inner circle in the early days of the Hololive Revolution, but strayed from the original Yagooist thought through Pekora, who she wholeheartedly believed in, especially in the doctrine of Idol nationalism. The rumours of Mel being a vampire were spread by an unknown source, likely by LHS slander but she leveraged the rumour and used it as a means to squash dissent in her nation.	Mel must defend her border from Yagoo directly and contend with the LHS trade embargo placed on her nation. It is only covertly through the Black Sea that Mel is able to reach the likeminded Pekora and bordering her North is a friendly, pro-Resistance Rushia. As the LHS's grip is weakening around the world, the unstable Aloe state seems to be a prime spot for expansion as the Banpire needs to spread her wings."

mel.1.t: "Aloe Demands Transylvania"
mel.1.d: "A missive arrives on Mel's desk in the early hours of the morning with a grave warning. A carefully worded ultimatum demanding the immediate return of the territory of Transylvania or face potentially dire consequences. Territorial concessions could secure peace given their historical claim on the region but at what cost? To give in would mean our hard fought gains are for nought."
mel.1.a: "If it means a lasting peace then you can have it back!"
mel.1.b: "Never!"

mel.2.t: "Aloe Demands Bessarabia"
mel.2.d: "Mel is interrupted during a meeting with a message from one of her inner circle. “Aloe has lodged a formal claim to the region of Bessarabia and has warned of devastating consequences should we refuse to peacefully surrender the territory.” Needless to say, the meeting was adjourned hastily. The decision now is whether or not securing some kind of peace is the correct path or not."
mel.2.a: "If it means peace…"
mel.2.b: "What nonsense! Bessarabia is ours!"

mel.3.t: "Aloe Demands Bessarabia and Transylvania"
mel.3.d: "Mel enters the inner chambers of the Palatul Parlamentului to a stark faced inner council. “A demand you see, from Aloe. It's significant concessions or face war.” The ultimatum was clear in its wording. Significant handovers of territory or face a potentially devastating war. To concede may secure peace but would have us cut down to a rump state given how significant these demands are. The debate within the inner circle is fierce but Mel's decision is clear…"
mel.3.a: "I see no other option here…"
mel.3.b: "What nonsense! This is our land!"

mel.4.t: "Yagoo Hands Over Banat"
mel.4.d: "Mel's morning is interrupted by a jubilant attendee with a very formal looking diplomatic letter. Our claims to the territory of Banat have been agreed upon and the immediate concession of the region is to take place. A round of Vișinată for all and three cheers for Mel!"
mel.4.a: "Today is a good day!"

mel.5.t: "Yagoo Denies Our Request"
mel.5.d: "Negotiations have ground to a halt. Despite our clear, rightful claims to the territory of Banat, Yagoo has seen fit to deny us the concessions we rightfully deserve. This constitutes a direct challenge to our nation and how we respond from here will truly determine our future. Given our precarious position and potentially very few allies, is now the time to move against Yagoo or do we accept that consolidating our current position is the correct path? To do nothing could easily be seen as weakness but to charge headfirst into war without careful consideration could be disastrous. Ultimately, Mel's decision is…."
mel.5.a: "Well what could we really do..."
mel.5.b: "For a Greater Romania!"

mel.6.t: "Yagoo Counter-Offers"
mel.6.d: "To the surprise of some, Yagoo has been receptive to the idea of handing over control of Banat to us. He does have some stipulations however, given the precarious position the LHS has been in recently, our immediate entry into the LHS Shield would be the asking price for the territory. Given our position and diplomatic relations to those around us, an ally could be of great use to us in the current climate. However, aligning ourselves directly with the LHS could be seen as counter to everything we've been fighting for over the past years and could upset a lot of people across the nation. Mel takes some time to think on the choices before ultimately deciding..."
mel.6.a: "I refuse to allow us to become a puppet of the LHS..."
mel.6.b: "This will be critical to our future. Contact Yagoo, the deal is on."
