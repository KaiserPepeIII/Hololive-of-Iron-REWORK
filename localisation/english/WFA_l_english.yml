WFA_finn_klelstrup: "Finn Kjelstrup"
WFA_finn_klelstrup_desc: "Infamous for being one of the WFA's more radical members, Finn Kjelstrup is the current head of the Hardliners faction. An intelligent diplomat and cunning soldier, he is also known to be a cold blooded and merciless killer with a strong view on Nordic supremacy.\n\nBefore the Great War, Kjelstrup had graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy. Following the end of Norway's union with Sweden, Kjelstrup became a mercenary for King Leopold. Being sent to the Congo Free State, it was here where Kjelstrup first made a name for himself by pacifying the natives, whether it was through diplomacy with local chiefs or brute force. Upon his return to Norway, Kjelstrup continued to serve in the Norwegian army, leading his troops against Fubuki when her forces invaded. Kjelstrup would be able to maintain his rank as an officer upon Fubuki's integration of the Norwegian army into her empire, and he became one of the first Norwegians to join the WFA's ranks as its prestige on the battlefield seemed to suit him. When the WFA was exiled to his native Norway as well as witnessing the bloodshed of The Great Northern War, Kjelstrup had an Epiphany. He believed that the WFA was better off under the command of a strong officer and that it would be his destiny to lead the WFA against Fubuki, liberating Scandinavia from her incompetent leadership.\n\nFollowing Von Schalburg secretly joining the Hardliners clique, Kjelstrup often came to blows with his regarding strategy. Despite their differences both men played a key part in the infamous Brigadier's Plot, purging the WFA of any loyalists. Following Von Schalburg's death, Kjelstrup has now taken the reins of the WFA. One step closer to him enacting his delusional dream."
WFA_christian_kryssling: "Christian Peder Kryssing"
WFA_christian_kryssling_desc: "One of the most seasoned and experienced veterans within the WFA, Christian Peder Kryssing was a loyal member of the WFA and to Fubuki since he first enlisted. A proponent of superior firepower, Kryssing like many within the loyalist clique, wishes to have the WFA remain loyal to Fubuki.\n\nKryssing had been an ardent anti-Communist and nationalist since 1910, when he joined the Danish army. First seeing action against Fubuki as an artillery officer, once Denmark was annexed in 1920 Kryssing, like many young officers, was integrated into Fubuki's regular army. Over time Kryssing's belief moved away from that of resentment to loyalty, as he believed Fubuki's reign and policies brought prosperity to his homeland. His newfound loyalty and skill in the field landed him as an NCO within the WFA. He would later be sent to the Baltics, fighting in the Great Northern War.\n\nCombined with his pre-war experience and later action during the Great North War resulted in Kryssing becoming one of the most respected and decorated officers within the WFA. His reputation and rank made him one of the most influential figures within the regime, which made him a key figure in the aftermath of Von Schalburg's assassination. With his leadership of the WFA secure, the ever loyal Kryssing is set to guide the WFA back to fighting for Fubuki and her ideals."
WFA_christian_shalburg: "Christian Frederik von Schalburg"
WFA_christian_frederick_von_schalburg_desc: "Acting General of the White Fox Army, Christian Frederik von Schalburg rules Norway and several Northern islands under a strict military dictatorship. A veteran of the Great Northern War, Von Schalburg prides himself on his staunch reactionism as much as upholding his militaristic duty to maintain order within the WFA's territories.\n\nBorn in Siberia to a Russian Noblewoman and a Danish man, Von Schalburg had received military education as a child when he was part of the Tsar's Cadet Corps. When the Russian Revolution broke out, Von Schalburg and his family fled to Denmark, just in time to witness it fall under the control of Fubuki's Scandinavian Empire, with the WFA spearheading the invasion. Having been impressed by these elite shock troopers in action, Von Schalburg decided to join the WFA when he was old enough, and he quickly rose within the ranks. His first taste of combat was in 1932 during the Great Northern War. Like much of the White Fox Army, his unit had suffered heavy casualties as they fought in the Baltics and Northern Germany.\n\nHis actions during the war quickly accelerated his career and by the time the ceasefire between Fubuki and Noel had come into effect, he held the rank of General which he holds to this day. Now Von Schalburg controls the WFA as infighting between various factions within the ranks plagues the once proud army. Loyalists who wish to remain under Fubuki's command and the Hardliners who wish to break away from Fubuki's influence. Von Schalburg is given the daunting task of maintaining balance between these two factions, before either of them tips the scales and enacts their vision of the WFA's future."

WFA_kund_martinsen: "Kund Borge Martinsen"
WFA_kund_martinsen_desc: "Kund Borge Martinsen is a highly decorated officer in the WFA's ranks, and one of the few who remain loyal to Fubuki despite being exiled to Norway. A skilled commander, he also openly supports reintegrating the WFA back into the ranks of Fubuki's army.\n\nWhen Martinsen was 15 years old, Fubuki's armies occupied his native Denmark. At first Martinsen had opposed Fubuki's rule, joining a minor resistance movement which spread propaganda pamphlets and vandalized government property, which landed him in jail multiple times. However as he grew older Martinsen gradually became more open to Fubuki's reign, leading to him joining the White Fox Army. Even as it was exiled to Norway, he continued to rise through the ranks. He became an NCO just in time for the outbreak of the Great Northern War, serving on the frontlines like many of his peers.\n\nWhen Von Schalburg was killed and Karl Marthinsen declared himself General of Norge, Martinsen not only opposed this but also saw it as an opportunity to secure more power. Denouncing Karl Marthinsen as illegitimate and a traitor, Martinsen rallied those loyal to him to oppose Karl Marthinsen, warning that the influence of the Statspolitiet threatened military rule in the WFA. Now leader of the WFA, Martinsen can enact his vision of returning the WFA under Fubuki's graces, rebuilding its legacy as her loyal soldiers."

WFA_karl_marthinsen: "Karl Marthinsen"
WFA_karl_marthinsen_desc: "Judge, Jury and Executioner. Three words that describe Karl Marthinsen, the former chief of the Statspolitiet and one of the most senior members of the WFA. Due to his former position, it is no surprise that Marthinsen is a man deeply devoted to upholding his vision of order and justice no matter how harsh it may seem.\n\nEnlisting in the Scandinavian army in 1918, one of Marthinsen's first assignments was as a border guard in the far north at the Norway-Russian border. There he had seen columns of cold, starving refugees who told stories of the chaos and bloodshed gripping Russia. Fearing such a collapse in society would happen to his empire and native homeland, Marthinsen developed a ruthless sense of maintaining order as he then joined the White Fox Army a year later in 1919. Marthinsen used the WFA's military police, the Statspolitiet to combat disloyal Scandinavians who still resisted Fubuki's reign until the WFA's exile to Norway. There the Statspolitiet evolved into Norway's militarized national police force, to which Marthinsen used to terrorize his countrymen, enforcing the WFA's laws. When the Great Northern War broke out, Marthinsen was not part of the invasion force, staying behind to maintain order in Norway. Even without the prestige of fighting in combat, Marthinsen had accumulated massive amounts of power within the WFA, as its chief enforcer of the law.\n\nith the death of Von Schalburg, Marthinsen now finds himself ruling over the WFA. Tasked with maintaining the nation's stability, Marthinsen's harsh view of order and discipline may save the WFA or push it further into chaos should he go too far."
WFA_vidkun_quisling: "Vidkun Quisling"
WFA_vidkun_quisling_desc: "Compared to his peers, Vidkun Quisling is an outcast. He isn't a pan-Nordic supremacist like the hardliners of the WFA, nor does he support Fubuki's rule like the loyalists. What Quisling most desires is an independent Norway, under his dictatorial rule and following his vision of Norwegian nationalism.\n\nIn his youth, Quisling was a highly intelligent academist with particular interest in history, natural sciences, and humanities. This granted him particular attention as he was the highest scoring graduate in the Norwegian Military College, which granted him an audience from King Haakon VII. By the time of the Great War, Quisling was part of Norway's General Staff. Watching Norway stand idly by as Europe tore itself asunder and the following rebellions by the Hololive Idols, Quisling was itching to join the fight. His wish was granted when he was sent as an attache to White Russia during the Civil War. His authoritarian views began to flourish upon witnessing the White Army's incompetence and infighting as it fought the Idols and Bolsheviks. War would soon come to Norway and Quisling was among those commanding its forces against Fubuki's armies. Despite being on the losing side, Quisling would be allowed to walk free though at the cost of his position as an officer. He spent the next few years traveling across Europe before he would return to Norway, now under the command of the White Fox Army.\n\nJoining Von Schalburg's council as Minister of Armaments, Quisling would maneuver his way around the WFA's intricate networks of cliques and factions, before being swayed to join the Pro-Fubuki side by Karl Marthinsen with the promise of further political power. Following the WFA Civil War, Quisling used his new high ranking position and the weakened state of the WFA to forcefully seize control of The Storting, proclaiming himself as the new Minister President of Norway, set to hopefully defend his nation from both the WFA and Fubuki."
