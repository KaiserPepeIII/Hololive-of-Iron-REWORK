generic_focus.1.t: "The Legacy of Brugg"
generic_focus.1.desc: "As the fires of the Great War died down and the guns ceased firing, the warring nations met in Brugg, Switzerland to sign the treaty that would put an end to the decade of bloodshed and redraw the world's borders. 17 years later, the effects of the Treaty of Brugg are still being felt across the globe. As entire world spanning empires were erased from the map, new nations led by idols emerged to take their place. These new countries were divided between two competing alliances. The League of Hololive States, followers of Yagoo and his vision of global peace and The Resistance who reject Yagoo's global hegemony. Between these two alliances are fringe groups that reject the notion of idols ruling their homelands and hope to one day reclaim their nations from both LHS and Resistance influence. As the LHS and Resistance teeter closer to war and the balance of power set by the Treaty of Brugg breaks down, we must choose where our allegiances lie in an ever evolving and complicated world."
generic_focus.1.a: "Let us forge our path in world history."
